       "   'Barack Hussein Obama II ( (listen) bə-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-mə; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, Obama was the first African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.\\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black person to be president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district from 1997 until 2004 in the Illinois Senate, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president a year after his presidential campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain and was inaugurated alongside his running mate, Joe Biden, on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\\nObama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as ACA or \"Obamacare\"), although without a public health insurance option, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimuli amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya for the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni Al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki.\\nAfter winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered the JCPOA nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland faced partisan obstruction from the Republican-led Senate led by Mitch McConnell, which never held hearings or a vote on the nomination. Obama left office in January 2017 and continues to reside in Washington, D.C.During Obama\\'s term in office, the United States\\' reputation abroad, as well as the American economy, significantly improved. His presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public frequently place him among the upper tier of American presidents.\\n\\n',\n",

537 the church was then the worlds largest interior space and among the first to employ a fully pendentive dome It is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have changed the

ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople it remained the worlds largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520 Beginning with subsequent Byzantine

because they do not use sleds\\nA resurfaced race in 2020 is the Klondike Dog Derby a 40mile race around Lake Minnetonka in Excelsior Minnesota The race began in the 1930s and died out in 1998 until recently restarting The majority of sled dog races in North America are held close to the northern border of the United States or farther north Wellattended races in the United States such as the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon Apostle Island Sled Dog Race and the UP 200 all take place in the upper regions of Minnesota Wisconsin and Michigan respectively After these races the majority of dog sled races take place farther north in Canada or Alaska The Klondike Dog Derby is one of few held in a more urban area that is not in the far north Bringing the sport to an urban area of Minnesota has brought attention from local news sources and residents allowing for firsthand familiarization and education of the sport of mushing that is otherwise hard to come across in an area that is not in the far north The accessory events held the weekend of the Klondike Dog Derby include the HugaHusky event Meet the Musher and allotted time for the public to hear mushers talk and answer questions on the sport These events follow the same outline as the Klondike Dog Derby originally had starting in the 1930s during Hennepin Countys winter ice carnivals The original race took place during a festival held annually by the Works Progress Administration called Klondike Day The festival featured a coronation of an Ice Princess and Ice Queen a snow modeling contest ski races a skating party and the dog derby The race featured different classes and allowed people of all ages to harness their dogs to any sled they had at their disposal This served as a way to connect sled dog racing to the people and bring the community together thus bringing further attention to the sport throughout the area The race was reintroduced in 2020 as a tribute dog mushers and their commitment to the sport The race allows for spectators and gives people an opportunity to meet the racers and their dogs This is meant to create a more interactive atmosphere surrounding the sport in the upper MidwestThere are three typical types of sled dog races sprint middistance and longdistance These types can be broken down into subtypes Sprint races cover relatively short distances of 4 to 25 milesday middistance races cover a total of 100 to 300 miles and longdistance races cover 300 miles to more than 1000 miles Sprint races frequently are two or threeday events with heats run on successive days with the same dogs on the same course Middistance races are either heat races of 14 to 80 miles per day or continuous races of 100 to 200 miles These categories are informal and may overlap to a certain extent Longdistance races may be continuous or stage races in which participants run a different course each day usually from a central staging location\\nGenerally teams start one after another in equal time intervals competing against the clock rather than directly against one another This is due to logistic considerations of getting teams of dogs to the starting line for a clean timed start Mass starts where all of the dog teams start simultaneously are popular in parts of Canada Another mode of dogsled racing is the freight race in which a specified weight per dog is carried in the sled',\n",

       " 'Tornadoes are more common in the United States than in any other country or state The United States receives more than 1200 tornadoes annually—four times the amount seen in Europe Violent tornadoes—those rated EF4 or EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale—occur more often in the United States than in any other countryMost tornadoes in the United States occur east of the Rocky Mountains The Great Plains the Midwest the Mississippi Valley and the southern United States are all areas that are vulnerable to tornadoes They are relatively rare west of the Rockies and are also less frequent in the northeastern states Tornado Alley is a colloquial term for an area particularly prone to tornadoes There is no officially defined Tornado Alley – at its broadest this area stretches from northern Texas to Canada with its core centered on Oklahoma Kansas and northern Texas Another highly significant region – colloquially known as Dixie Alley – is the southern United States and particularly the northern and central parts of Alabama and Mississippi Florida is one of the most tornadoprone states However Florida tornadoes only rarely approach the strength of those that occur elsewhere\\nAlthough favorable conditions for tornadoes in the United States can occur at any time they are most common in spring and least common in winter Because spring is a transitional period for the climate there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air resulting in more thunderstorms Tornadoes can also be spawned by landfalling tropical cyclones which usually occur in late summer and autumn In the United States thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes usually form when the temperature is at its highest typically from 400 pm to 700 pmAlthough the period in which most tornadoes strike tornado season is March through June tornadoes – including violent tornadoes and major tornado outbreaks – have been documented in the United States during every month of the year Two examples of this are when a series of tornadoes hit the state of Indiana on November 22 1992 and injured at least nine people Another notable nonseason tornado was where a tornado struck the area of McLean County Illinois Even though the tornado was during a winter month it blew 20 railroad cars off their tracks and hauled a camper over 100 yards 91 mDuring the winter months of the year tornadoes have been known to hit the Southern United States and Southeastern United States the most but have hit other areas as well One notable recent example of a winter tornado outbreak was the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak on February 5 and February 6 2008 84 tornadoes occurred over the course of the outbreak The storm system produced several destructive tornadoes in heavily populated areas most notably in the Memphis metropolitan area in Jackson Tennessee and the northeastern end of the Nashville metropolitan area At least 57 people were killed across four states and 18 counties with hundreds of others injured The outbreak was the deadliest of the modern NEXRAD doppler radar era until the 2011 Super Outbreak killed over 348 people 324 of which were tornadorelated It was the deadliest single outbreak since the May 31 1985 outbreak which killed 76 across Ohio and Pennsylvania as well claiming 12 victims in Ontario Canada It was also the deadliest outbreak in both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super OutbreakUsually tornadoes hit specific areas of the United States in specific seasons During the winter months tornadoes are usually spotted in the Southern area of the country as well as states near the Gulf of Mexico This is due to cold air moving southward reaching its southern limit of expansion and stopping over the Gulf Coast As spring comes hot air progressively moves back into the Gulf Coast This pushes the mass of colder air forward out of the Gulf States and into the Southeastern states where tornado frequency is highest in AprilAs spring passes and summer begins the mass of warm moist air moves northwest into the Great Plains and Midwestern states During the months of May and June tornado activity is as its peak in the southern Great Plains The air mass then moves northward into the Northern Great Plains and the Great Lakes area causing a tornado activity peak in these areas during the summer months During the late summer and early fall months tornado activity in the United States tapers off This is due to the relatively small difference between the temperature at the boundary of the hot air mass and the cool air mass at that time and an extension of the Bermuda High sitting over parts of the United States Though there may be some thunderstorms they dont often become severe enough to spawn tornadoesTornadoes may be formed out of season especially during the months of hurricane season in the Gulf Coast states and Southeastern states Because these areas are prone to hurricanes they may be struck with tornadoes that are spawned from hurricanes Tornadoes are most likely to form in the rightfront quadrant of the hurricane but can also form in rain bands associated with the storm This is caused by the large amount of vertical wind shear to the right of the storm Tornadoes are also spawned from US hurricanes due to the moistness of the air at the landfall of the storm which makes conditions favorable for a supercell storm to develop within the hurricane',\n",

       " 'The Soviet–Afghan War was a conflict wherein insurgent groups known collectively as the Mujahideen as well as smaller Maoist groups fought a nineyear guerrilla war against the Soviet Army and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan government throughout the 1980s mostly in the Afghan countryside The Mujahideen were variously backed primarily by the United States Pakistan Iran Saudi Arabia China and the United Kingdom the conflict was a Cold Warera proxy war Between 562000 and 2000000 civilians were killed and millions of Afghans fled the country as refugees mostly to Pakistan and Iran The war caused grave destruction in Afghanistan and is believed to have contributed to the Soviet collapse in hindsight leaving a mixed legacy to people in both territoriesThe foundations of the conflict were laid by the Saur Revolution a 1978 coup wherein Afghanistans communist party took power initiating a series of radical modernization and land reforms throughout the country These reforms were deeply unpopular among the more traditional rural population and established power structures The repressive nature of the Democratic Republic which vigorously suppressed opposition and executed thousands of political prisoners led to the rise of antigovernment armed groups by April 1979 large parts of the country were in open rebellion The communist party itself experienced deep internal rivalries between the Khalqists and Parchamites in September 1979 Peoples Democratic Party General Secretary Nur Mohammad Taraki was assassinated under orders of the secondincommand Hafizullah Amin which soured relations with the Soviet Union Eventually the Soviet government under leader Leonid Brezhnev decided to deploy the 40th Army across the border on December 24 1979 Arriving in the capital Kabul they staged a coup Operation Storm333 killing General Secretary Amin and installing Soviet loyalist Babrak Karmal from the rival faction Parcham The deployment had been variously called an invasion by Western media and the rebels or a legitimate supporting intervention by the Soviet Union and the Afghan government on the basis of the Brezhnev Doctrine\\nIn January 1980 foreign ministers from 34 nations of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation adopted a resolution demanding the immediate urgent and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan The UN General Assembly passed a resolution protesting the Soviet intervention by a vote of 104 for to 18 against with 18 abstentions and 12 members of the 152nation Assembly absent or not participating in the vote only Soviet allies Angola East Germany and Vietnam along with India supported the intervention Afghan insurgents began to receive massive amounts of support through aid finance and military training in neighbouring Pakistan with significant help from the United States and United Kingdom They were also heavily financed by China and the Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf As documented by the National Security Archive the Central Intelligence Agency CIA played a significant role in asserting US influence in Afghanistan by funding military operations designed to frustrate the Soviet invasion of that country CIA covert action worked through Pakistani intelligence services to reach Afghan rebel groups Soviet troops occupied the cities and main arteries of communication while the Mujahideen waged guerrilla war in small groups operating in the almost 80 percent of the country that was outside government and Soviet control almost exclusively being the rugged mountainous terrain of the countryside The Soviets used their air power to deal harshly with both rebels and civilians levelling villages to deny safe haven to the Mujahideen destroying vital irrigation ditches and laying millions of land minesThe international community imposed numerous sanctions and embargoes against the Soviet Union and the US led a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow The boycott and sanctions exacerbated Cold War tensions and enraged the Soviet government which later led a revenge boycott of the 1984 Olympics held in Los Angeles The Soviets initially planned to secure towns and roads stabilize the government under new leader Karmal and withdraw within six months or a year But they were met with fierce resistance from the guerillas and had difficulties on the harsh cold Afghan terrain resulting in them being stuck in a bloody war that lasted nine years By the mid1980s the Soviet contingent was increased to 108800 and fighting increased but the military and diplomatic cost of the war to the USSR was high By mid1987 the Soviet Union now under reformist leader General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev announced it would start withdrawing its forces after meetings with the Afghan government The final troop withdrawal started on May 15 1988 and ended on February 15 1989 leaving the government forces alone in the battle against the insurgents which continued until 1992 when the former Sovietbacked government collapsed Due to its length it has sometimes been referred to as the Soviet Unions Vietnam War or the Bear Trap by the Western media The Soviets failure in the war is thought to be a contributing factor to the fall of the Soviet Union It has left a mixed legacy in the former Soviet Union and in Afghanistan Additionally US policies in the war are also thought to have contributed to a blowback of unintended consequences against American interests',\n",

       " 'The War in Afghanistan is an ongoing war following the United States invasion of Afghanistan that began when the United States of America and its allies successfully drove the Taliban from power in order to deny AlQaeda a safe base of operations in Afghanistan Since the initial objectives were completed a coalition of over 40 countries including all NATO members formed a security mission in the country called International Security Assistance Force ISAF succeeded by the Resolute Support Mission RS in 2014 of which certain members were involved in military combat allied with Afghanistans government The war has afterwards mostly consisted of Taliban insurgents fighting against the Afghan Armed Forces and allied forces the majority of ISAFRS soldiers and personnel are American The war is code named by the US as Operation Enduring Freedom 2001–14 and Operation Freedoms Sentinel 2015–present it is the longest war in US history\\nFollowing the September 11 attacks in 2001 on the US which was carried out by the AlQaeda terrorist organization led by Osama bin Laden who was living or hiding in Afghanistan and had already been wanted since the 1998 United States embassy bombings President George W Bush demanded that the Taliban who were de facto ruling Afghanistan hand over bin Laden The Taliban declined to extradite him unless they were provided clear evidence of his involvement in the attacks which the US refused to provide and dismissed as a delaying tactic On October 7 2001 the United States with the United Kingdom launched Operation Enduring Freedom To justify the War the Bush administration claimed that Afghanistan only had selective sovereignty and that intervention was necessary because the Taliban threatened the sovereignty of other states The two were later joined by other forces including the Northern Alliance – the Afghan opposition which had been fighting the Taliban in the ongoing civil war since 1996 By December 2001 the Taliban and their AlQaeda allies were mostly defeated in the country and at the Bonn Conference new Afghan interim authorities mostly from the Northern Alliance elected Hamid Karzai to head the Afghan Interim Administration The United Nations Security Council established the ISAF to assist the new authority with securing Kabul which after a 2002 loya jirga grand assembly became the Afghan Transitional Administration A nationwide rebuilding effort was also made following the end of the totalitarian Taliban regime In the popular elections of 2004 Karzai was elected president of the country now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan NATO became involved in ISAF in August 2003 and later that year assumed leadership of it At this stage ISAF included troops from 43 countries with NATO members providing the majority of the force One portion of US forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command the rest remained under direct US command\\nFollowing defeat in the initial invasion the Taliban was reorganized by its leader Mullah Omar and launched an insurgency against the Afghan government and ISAF in 2003 Though outgunned and outnumbered insurgents from the Taliban

animal species some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the pressures of a growing human population Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian Bantu Arab South Asian Chinese and European The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian Bantu North Indian Arab and Somali settlersCenturies of intermarriages created the Malagasy people who primarily speak Malagasy an Austronesian language with Bantu Malay Arabic French and English influences Most

island typified by rule under a local chieftain Among some communities such as the Sakalava Merina and Betsimisaraka leaders seized the opportunity to unite these disparate communities and establish true kingdoms under their rule These kingdoms increased their wealth and power through exchanges with European Arab and other seafaring traders whether they were legitimate vessels or pirates\\nBetween the 16th and 18th centuries pirate activity in the coastal areas of Madagascar was common The purported free pirate colony of Libertatia was established on Île SainteMarie originally

freedIn French Madagascar Malagasy were required to fulfill corvée labor on Frenchrun plantations which generated high revenues for the colonial administration Opportunities for Malagasy to access education or skilled positions within the colonial structure were limited although some basic services like schools and clinics were extended to coastal areas for the first time The capital city was largely transformed and modernized and the royal palaces were transformed into a school and later a museum Although Malagasy were initially prevented from forming political parties several militant

BirdNote shows are two-minute vignettes that incorporate the sounds of birds with stories that illustrate their way of life. Shows can be heard on radio, online, and via podcast.\\nThe BirdNote broadcast originated in the Pacific Northwest under the umbrella of the Seattle Audubon Society, a chapter of the National Audubon Society and now operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Tune In to Nature. The show airs seven days a week on KNKX, an affiliate of  National Public Radio, and also on KTOO-FM, KJJF, KWMR, WNPR/Connecticut Public Radio, WRVO, KPBX, KCAW, KYRS, KPFZ, KHSU, KRTS, KUNM, and nearly 150 other public radio stations across the country, as well as in Canada, and the Philippines. The podcast reaches many more countries. Stories range from natural history to conservation to the language and music of birds.\\nBirdNote\\'s goal is \"to help people connect to the natural world and, for a couple minutes, have respite from the daily grind.\" Story subjects have included Rachel Carson, Roger Tory Peterson, Aldo Leopold, Frank Chapman, Barry Lopez, Terry Tempest Williams, Ivan Doig, Tony Angell, whooping crane migration, the extinction of the dodo, birds in myth, music, and pop culture, and the natural history of hundreds of species of birds.',\n",
       "   'An ocean is a body of water that composes much of a planet\\'s hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The phrases \"the ocean\" or \"the sea\" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of the Earth\\'s surface. As a general term, \"the ocean\" is mostly interchangeable with \"the sea\" in American English, but not in British English. Strictly speaking, a sea is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.Saline seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth\\'s surface and 90% of the Earth\\'s biosphere. The ocean contains 97% of Earth\\'s water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 20% of the World\\'s Ocean has been mapped. The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100 ft).As the world ocean is the principal component of Earth\\'s hydrosphere, it is integral to life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The World Ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species, but because much of it is unexplored, the number of species in the ocean is much larger, possibly over two million. The origin of Earth\\'s oceans is unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the cause for the emergence of life.\\nExtraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan, although there is evidence for oceans\\' existence elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of the moon Europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System\\'s giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone. Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.',\n",
       "   'The Attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service upon the United States (a neutral country at the time) against the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, just before 08:00, on Sunday morning, December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States\\' formal entry into World War II the next day. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI, and as Operation Z during its planning. Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time (18:18 GMT). The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. Of the eight U.S. Navy battleships present, all were damaged, with four sunk. All but USS Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer. A total of 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. Kazuo Sakamaki, the commanding officer of one of the submarines, was captured.Japan announced declarations of war on the United States and the British Empire later that day (December 8 in Tokyo), but the declarations were not delivered until the following day. The British government declared war on Japan immediately after learning that their territory had also been attacked, while the following day (December 8) Congress declared war on Japan. On December 11, despite the fact they had no formal obligation to do so under the Tripartite Pact with Japan, Germany and Italy each declared war on the U.S., which responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. There were numerous historical precedents for the unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while peace negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, \"a date which will live in infamy\". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.',\n",
       "   \"Franklin's lost expedition was a British voyage of Arctic exploration led by Captain Sir John Franklin that departed from England in 1845 aboard two ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, and was assigned to traverse the last unnavigated sections of the Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic. The expedition met with disaster after both ships and their crews, a total of 129 officers and men, became icebound in Victoria Strait near King William Island, in what is today the Canadian territory of Nunavut. After being icebound for more than a year, Erebus and Terror were abandoned in April 1848, by which point Franklin and nearly two dozen others had died. The survivors, now led by Franklin's deputy Francis Crozier and Erebus' captain James Fitzjames, set out for the Canadian mainland and disappeared.Pressed by Franklin's wife and others, the Admiralty launched a search for the missing expedition in 1848. In the many subsequent searches in the decades afterward, several relics from the expedition were uncovered, including the remains of two men that were returned to Britain. A series of scientific studies in modern times suggested that the men of the expedition did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning or zinc deficiency, and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845. Cut marks on some of the bones recovered during these studies also proved allegations of cannibalism reported by Franklin searcher John Rae in 1854.\\nDespite the expedition’s infamous status, it did explore the vicinity of what was ultimately one of many Northwest Passages to be discovered. Robert McClure led one of many expeditions to investigate the fate of Franklin’s voyage, and finally ascertained an ice-bound route that connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and made it out alive. This trip was similarly beset by immense challenges and controversies. The Northwest Passage would not be navigated by boat until 1906, when Roald Amundsen traversed the passage on the Gjøa.\\nIn 2014, a Canadian search team led by Parks Canada located the wreck of Erebus in the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf. Two years later, the Arctic Research Foundation found the wreck of Terror south of King William Island. Research and dive expeditions at the wreck sites, now protected as a combined National Historic Site, are currently ongoing.\",\n",

       "   'The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.\\nIn the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign that devastated 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe concluded when Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific War. By July 1945, the Allies\\' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs: \"Fat Man\", a plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon; and \"Little Boy\", an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon. The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces  was trained and equipped with  the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and deployed to Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945, the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\". Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.\\nThe consent of the United Kingdom was obtained for the bombing, as was required by the Quebec Agreement, and orders were issued on July 25 for atomic bombs to be used against Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki. These targets were chosen because they were large urban areas that also held militarily significant facilities. On August 6, a Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima; three days later, a Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki. Over the next two to four months, the effects of the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half occurred on the first day. For months afterward, large numbers of people continued to die from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. Most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.\\nJapan surrendered to the Allies on August 15, six days after the Soviet Union\\'s declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September 2, effectively ending the war. Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings.'],\n",

       "{136: {'docs': [\" A Letter written on Oct 30, 1937  A Letter written on Oct 30, 1937     Department of Chemistry, Yenching University, Peiping, - October  30, 1937.  Extracts from the Adolph Diary: 1937.   January: Ice skating on the Yenching lake at its prime. EHA, in  the 8th grade, North China American School, makes the hockey team. HMA,  freshman at Mount Holyoke College, amkes her second all-Holyoke athletic team  (basketball). WHA Jr., sophomore at Yale University (Calhoun College), works in  biology and plays football and basketball on his college team. DMA (8 yrs.)  tutors at home and specializes in dolls. - Through traffic opens on the trunk  line railway from Canton to Hankow; great strides in national reconstruction.   February: WHA serves on commission of five under the Council of  Public Health to prepare a code of nutrition standards for China. Cereals now  supply 85 percent of the food intake; we urge that this be replaced in part by  more green vegetables and legumes. Milk is not available; imagine asking a  health officer in America to work out a nutritional regime for school children  without milk!  March: The nutrition research program continues; we are peering  into the reported sub-normal calcium intake of the Chinese dietary, 0.3-0.4  grams per day. One of our staff is just now conducting a 30-day metabolism  study on a rural group of 15 subjects at a point 500 miles away; and samples  are to be transported back to Peiping for analysis. - Two holidays in March; we  again hike with students to the hills, and roast hot dogs in the ruins of an  ancient abbey. - We hear Mischa Elman at the Hotel de Pekin.  April: Spring vacation; KWA and WHA spend 4 days at the Chin  Hsien monstery in the hills. There are white pines, temple bells, a trickling  spring, and no lectures, no seminars, no telephones.  May: HMA plays tennis at Holyoke and decides to major in  chemistry. - Professor Niels Bohr visits Peiping and lectures on the atom. -  Tsinghua and Yenching faculties meet in annual tennis tournament; Yenching wins.   June: We exploit our lawn and garden: a moonlight garden party,  student afternoon teas. The premedical juniors play 'monopoly' all of one  afternoon to celebrate their last examination and forget to go home for supper.  - Commencement; KWA with EHA and DMA leave for our summer mountain camp on Tai  Shan. - WHA Jr. and HMA in USA arrange for summer at Silver Bay, N.Y.  July: WHA attends Independence Day reception (July 4) at the  American Embassy in Peiping and two days later joins the family in Shantung,  taking one of the last trains through to the south.  July 8: Friction: Chinese and Japanese military near Peiping;  attempts at peaceful settlement; general anxiety. -- Meanwhile all is quiet on  the sacred mountain, our holiday undisturbed: mountain hikes and swimming; WHA  struggles with another packet of chemistry MS.  July 27: Communications with Peiping suddenly cease and we know  that the Sino-Japanese conflict has burst into flames.  August 1: No mail from the north, only vague rumors of the  capture of Tientsin and Peiping. A wire arrives advising British and Americans  in Shantung to leave immediately for the coast. We decide to wait further news  and finish eating lunch, but at the same time conjecture what one would choose  to pack into a suitcase for a hurried evacuation. At tea another wire arrives:  situation not immediately serious. From our veranda we watch in the distance  the steady procession of Chinese troop trains northward.  August 6: A Shanghai daily brings Peiping-Tientsin news: Nankai  University bombed and destroyed, some fighting east and west of Peiping;  Yenching University is intact, and this means our home on the campus is  unmolested. Will the universities in Peiping be able to open in September? -  Tai Shan remains peaceful.  August 12-14: Dr. & Mrs. EDH, guests from America, arrive via  Shanghai for brief visit and rush back again. Trains suddenly become irregular;  hostilities at Shanghai; will they be able to make steamer connections for USA?   August 15: Wire from American consul asks us to evacuate to the  port of Tsingtao; there is fear railways will be cut; we pack trunks and leave  the next day. We pass trains crowded with Chinese citizenry in flight from the  cities to the country districts. - Tsingtao streets deserted; nervous tension;  a motor truck backfires and sends frightened pedestrians to shelter. We  patronize the swimming beach. - News arrives that Peiping is quiet, hostilities  over, and that Yenching will open. We resolve to return home by first steamer  north. Banks refuse our Shanghai checks; American consulate advances funds.  August 23: Steamer schedules no longer exist, but hearing that  the S. S. Hupeh (British) leaves for Tientsin to-day we rush aboard and sail  this afternoon. - British, American and Japanese gunboats crowd the harbor.  August 26-27: Arrive at Tientsin; we have sailed around the war  zone and are now in the occupied territory north of the battle front. Foreign  concessions at Tientsin are filled with rumors and refugees. The train to  Peiping takes 6 hours instead of the accustomed 2 hours, but this is much  better than the 12-hour schedule of a week ago. The Japanese army of occupation  is very much in evidence: military police on the train and a heavily armed  guard at each station. Peiping looks normal, the campus as attractive as ever;  the university is flying the American flag.  September 2: Aeroplanes overhead, heavy cannonading, active  fighting on the front 20 miles southwest of Peiping. Tanks and supply trains  motor past our campus. - Our bus to the city is stopped at the Hsi Chih gate  for regular military inspection.  September 8: A week of night raids by robbers near the campus.  The suburban police, disarmed when Peiping was occupied, are practically  helpless. Stores and shops nearby are closing and residents moving away. - EHA  and DMA start class work at the American School.  September 10: Professor Chen's home on edge of campus visited by  desperadoes who relieve him of $200. Next morning police report capture of an  entire burglar band plus $200.; they were armed with toy pistols!  September 13: Yenching opens; enrollment 500, instead of our  usual 800. Five other universities in the city remain closed. Safe conducts are  arranged for students and staff travelling from Tientsin. Half of chemistry  staff are delayed, the rest of us carry double teaching loads. - The Chinese  postal service, most adaptable of all organizations, still functions and gets  the mails through. Shanghai mail, normally requiring 36 hours, now requires 3  weeks. American mail 8-10 weeks. - Vigorous censorship; most of the newspapers  suppressed or reorganized under new dispensation; the Peiping Chronicle  (English) continues. Communism is the principal focus of attack, and school  textbooks are censored to eliminate objectionable ideas.  September 21: A cholera scare; we taste Japanese efficiency; all  travellers and commuters into the city must receive injections. - Business in  Peiping at a standstill; thousands out of emplyment; special relief campaign.  Yenching staff respond to university financial difficulties by voting a salary  cut.  October: Few tourist visitors, unusually small group of exchange  professors at Yenching. Scientific societies have cancelled their 1937 meetings  and research institutions have ceased work or moved. Journals are moving  editorial offices from the bombed areas. - In Peiping many phases of life  flourish in spite of hostilities: the Institute of Fine Arts, International  Club, Society of Natural History, Society of Experimental Biology and Medicine.  Peiping, it is rumored, will be renamed Peking. Another report says we are to  have automatic telephones; this will save time, but we will no longer make a  hypothetical bow to the operator in making a call. - The political atmosphere  at present is clouded, but the outlook is bright. There is every reason for  optimism; we are seeing one of the struggles that is developing modern China. -  Mails from abroad bring anxious inquiries about the fate of Peiping. Please be  assured we are hard at work, oru laboratory program continues and Yenching  University carries on! - We send best wishes and holiday greetings!  Wm. H. Adolph.   \",\n",

       "   ' Portuguese Military Academy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Portuguese Military Academy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to: navigation, search   The Military Academy (Academia Militar) is a Portuguese  military establishment, which has the ability to confer educational  qualifications equivalent to a university. It develops activities of teaching,  research and support for the communities with the purpose of training and  forming officers for thePortuguese Army and the Republican National Guard.

AU was chartered by anact of the United States Congress in  1893, nearly a century after Washington\\'s death, and ground was broken in 1896.  After some difficulties with funding, the first degrees were awarded in1916,  and the first undergraduates were admitted in1925.  During both World War I and World War II, the university allowed the U.S.  military to use some of its grounds for testing. In 1917, the US military  divided American University into two segments, Camp American University and  Camp Leach. Camp American University became the birthplace of the United  States\\' chemical weapons program, andchemical weapons were tested on the  grounds; this required a major cleanup effort in the1990s. Camp Leach was the  home to advanced research, develop and testing of moderncamouflage techniques.  During WWII, the campus was home to theUS Navy Bomb Disposal School and a WAVE  barracks. For AU\\'s role in these wartime efforts, theVictory Ship SS  American Victory was named in honor of the university. American took over  the previously unaffiliated Washington College of Law in1949, and added a  business school and an international relations program in the 1950s.  In the 1960s, the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency  operated a think tank under the guise ofOperation Camelot at American  University. The government abandoned the think tank after the operation came to  public attention. AU\\'s political intertwinement was furthered by President John F. Kennedy\\'s  Spring 1963 commencement address. In the speech, Kennedey called on the Soviet  Union to work with the United States to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty and  help reduce the considerable international tensions and the specter of nuclear  war during that juncture of theCold War.

But have you  ever thought about how a school\\'s price tag compares to how much its degree  will earn you in the future? SmartMoney recentlyreleased a list of the  universities that offer the biggest payoffs. By comparing tuition costs with  how much graduates were earning five and 15 years after graduation, they  created a payback ratio which shows the schools that are the best long-term  investments.   It turns out that several major public universities  offer the best bang for your buck. The Ivy League schools may come with more  prestige and better business networks, but their graduates do not necessarily  earn more than public school graduates in the long run.   To learn more  about SmartMoney\\'s findings and their ranking methodology, read thefull article . Here are some of the schools with the best payback ratio: \\xa0  Public Schools:    \\xa0\\xa0 1.

For the second year in  a row, eKnowledge, a company that sells SAT, ACT, and LSAT preparation  software, has teamed up with the NFL and the Department of Defense. Together  they will be contributing millions of dollars worth of eKnowledge\\'sSAT/ACT  PowerPrep Programs to members of the military and their families. They want  students in military families to have as much access to higher education as  possible during these trying times.   Anyone in the military, whether  retired or active, can request as many of the programs as they need for  students in their families. The Standard PowerPrep Program normally costs $199,  and military families get it for free (they only pay for shipping). The Premium  Program retails for $299.95, and military families can get this for $50. The  Combo Premium retails for $599.95 but is available to military families for  just $75.\\xa0 The software can be shipped to United States addresses and APO  addresses.   To ensure the discount only goes to those who are  eligible, the Department of Defense has made a secure website that confirms  military status.   At the time this blog post was written, 95,117  copies of the program had already been donated to military families. To learn  more about the military sponsorship and to order your copy of the PowerPrep  Program, go to theeKnowledge website.

You have to continue to  demonstrate that you challenge yourself and are committed to academic progress.  Take pride in your acceptance letters and live up to your future college\\'s  expectations. You never know- your college of choice could ask for second  semester course selections and grades. Do you think that your college is  looking for the applicant that benched his or her brain during senior year?  Ways to stay in shape for college:   Keep up the great work in AP classes: You could test in beyond college  freshman level courses. In some cases, you can even rack up college credit! Even if you are not scoring AP credits, taking college preparation courses  will help you ramp up for college-level courses.  Come on, you\\'ve  come so far in achieving your college dreams.

Edward Hebert, a  Louisiana Congressman, and graduated its first class in 1980. The university is  a center for military medical education and research. The primary mission of  the school is to prepare graduates for service to the country at home and  abroad in the medical corps. USUHS has officially changed its acronym to USU  (Uniformed Services University). Both the Medical School and Graduate School of  Nursing are located on the USU Campus, along with several research  departments.Students attending USU can focus on their education without the  worry of incurring debt. Medical students enter the university as commissioned  officers in one of the four uniformed services: Army, Navy, Air Force or Public  Health Service. No prior service is required for admission to USU. Students pay  no tuition or fees and, in fact, receive the full salary and benefits of a  uniformed officer throughout their four years at the university in exchange for  a seven-year active duty service commitment. Students in the Graduate Programs  are a mix of both civilians and uniformed officers. They also pay no tuition or  fees. Civilian students may receive stipends and uniformed graduate students  continue to receive their active duty pay and benefits while attending school  at USU. The Graduate School of Nursing students are all active duty uniformed  nurses or nurses in federal civilian service. Neither pay tuition or fees at  USU, and both continue to receive their regular salaries while students at the  university.The university currently has two mottos: \"Learning to Care For  Those In Harm\\'s Way\" and \"Providing Good Medicine In Bad Places.\" USU School of Medicine   With an enrollment of approximately 167  students per class, USU School of Medicine is located in Bethesda, Maryland on  the campus of the National Naval Medical Center and is located across Maryland  Route 355 from the National Institutes of Health. The school is named in honor  of former Congressman Felix Edward Hébert.Typically, the first year  class is composed of 63 Army students, 51 Air Force students, 51 Navy students,  and 2 Public Health Service students. The Class of 2010 increased the Public  Health Service student number to 6. Students attending this institution receive  free tuition, as well as reimbursement for all fees. Textbooks are issued to  the students at the beginning of each semester. USU School of Medicine students  are considered active duty military personnel during their schooling and  receive pay befiting the rank of O-1 (2nd Lieutenant for the Army and Air  Force, Ensign for the Navy and Public Health Service). Medical Students are not  promoted while enrolled in the School of Medicine and do not receive time in  grade or time in service. Upon graduation, these students are promoted to O-3  (Captain for the Army and Air Force, Lieutenant for the Navy and Public Health  Service) and are expected to serve at least 7 years active duty and 6 years on  inactive ready reserve. Currently, students graduating from the USU School of  Medicine receive four years credit toward retirement, which is obtained after  he or she reaches twenty years of service credit.Curriculum at the School of  Medicine includes two years of basic sciences, integrated into several key  courses. Additional courses include Parasitology, Combat Medical Skills,  Medical and Military History, Officer Professional Development, Military  Applied Physiology, Epidemiology, and several other courses. The third and  fourth years are spent performing clerkships at various military  hospitals.Approximately 80% of military physicians reaching 20 or more years of  service are graduates of USU. Also, a majority of medical corps leadership  positions are occupied by graduates of USU. Graduates of USU make up a majority  of Army Special Forces physicians.USU is featured in the upcoming release of  the documentary \"Fighting for Life\". It will address USU\\'s important  place in military medicine and the essential work that its graduates perform. USU Graduate School of Nursing  The Uniformed Services University of  the Health Sciences also has a Graduate School of Nursing (GSN). Students  enrolled in the GSN program maintain active duty rank and privileges, to  include time in service, time in grade, and promotions. USU Graduate School  The graduate programs in biomedical sciences and  public health in the USU School of Medicine are open to civilian and military  applicants. The graduate program at USU currently has approximately 170  full-time graduate students.

Incoming classes  usually range from 3 to 8 depending on the program. There is no tuition,  stipends are guaranteed for 3 years, and no military service is required after  graduation. There also is no undergraduate teaching. There are military  students in the graduate programs, notably Public Health, MPS, NES, PMB, and  any program that focuses on the military.

       "   \" Graduate Program | Department of Classical Studies  \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0        Current Students   The 30 students currently resident in Bloomington represent all sections  of the country, and a variety of college backgrounds including both large  universities similar to ours, and small liberal arts colleges. Because of the  relatively small size of our program, we are able to mentor all aspects of our  students' preparation for careers in scholarship and teaching. Each year several students present papers at the Annual Meetings of CAMWS and the APA; the  department offers some travel allowance to offset the cost and other funds are  available competitively through the Graduate School. We are committed to the  idea that all classics teachers should enjoy a first hand experience of Greek  and/or Roman sites, and we encourage their participation in the Summer Sessions  of the American Academy, American School of Classical Studies or appropriate  field archaeology programs. Funds for the partial support of summer study  abroad are available on a competitive basis from the Norman T. Pratt Travelling  Fellowship Fund, but many of our students have also been awarded fellowships  from CAMWS or from the summer programs themselves.

Many now say, \\'No.\\'  A year ago today, Americans were stunned by a brutal attack that  revealed deep resentment against US power. America from a pinnacle of military,  economic, and political might unmatched in history responded with force. In  what it has cast as a battle between good and evil, the US toppled the Taliban  and is now threatening \\'regime change\\' in Iraq. But Americans see their global  role differently from the way others see it.So the Monitor asked people in  16 countries this question: \\'Is America the good guy?\\' By Peter Ford | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor  In a small, plain office over a downtown Seoul grocery, eight young men  hunch over a bank of computers. They aren\\'t writing software or playing video  games. This is a command center for protest against American soldiers in Korea.  Everyone wears a black ribbon that reads \"US troops withdraw.\" The group one of dozens like it sprang up after a US armored vehicle  accidentally killed two Korean girls walking along a country road in June. The  incident continues to galvanize anti-American feeling across the country.  Members canvas neighborhoods, run e-mail campaigns detailing American soldiers\\'  alleged crimes, and help organize a permanent silent vigil outside the  presidential palace.

Two British views      monitortalk:  Join the discussion:   US is biggest rogue nation?       \"We are like a military operation\" says their leader, known only  as Mr. Kim. \"US troops here are a mistake of history and we won\\'t be one  country until they leave; 9/11 is not our problem.\" Most Americans believe they are making a sacrifice stationing 38,000  soldiers here to defend South Koreans against possible Communist attack. Most  ordinary Koreans, however, believe the US troops are actually here to promote  American interests, opinion polls show. And \"since 9/11, a strange but  virulent anti-Americanism has gripped South Korea,\" notes one expatriate  American who works at a US company in Seoul. \"The underlying reason that Uncle Sam is about as popular as the  plague,\" he adds, \"is because of a paradigm shift in the minds of a  new generation of South Koreans\" who regard the US troops as a colonial  presence. Along with Japan, South Korea is one of America\\'s chief strategic partners  in the Pacific. But you wouldn\\'t think so to watch a recent music video by  popular all-girl Korean band S.E.S. It features cowboy-booted Americans being  beaten up, fed to dogs, and tossed off buildings. Nor are American diplomats reassured by recent polls showing that nearly  half of Koreans approved the February trashing of the US Chamber of Commerce in  Seoul and that 60 percent of Koreans \"don\\'t like\" America. But if the US doesn\\'t wear a white hat here, where then? South Korea today offers one of the sharpest, and most surprising, examples  of anger at the US role in the world since Sept. 11. The current campaign grew  out of the girls\\' deaths and a widespread sense that the US authorities handled  the case clumsily. But there\\'s more to it than that. It seems to feed on old  grudges and a deep dismay at a newly unilateral America, touting a \"with  us or against us\" approach. /P>  A year ago, in the wake of Sept. 11, even some of Washington\\'s fiercest  critics proclaimed in sympathy, \"We are all Americans.\" But those  sentiments began to fade after the inadvertent US bombing of civilians in  Afghanistan. Today, even some of the country\\'s firmest friends are alarmed by  America\\'s apparent unwillingness to take into account the views of other  nations on issues ranging from the environment to dealing with Iraq. As the sole superpower for the past decade, America was already retooling  its relationship with the rest of the planet before Sept. 11. It pulled out of  the Kyoto treaty on climate change, a step that rankled many. But the attack on  America accelerated the change. The United States feels threatened by Al Qaeda,  and it\\'s making its vast military and political superiority felt with  unprecedented vigor sending soldiers into Central Asia, Georgia, and the  Philippines. That is having an effect. Scores of interviews with government officials,  political analysts, and ordinary citizens from one side of the globe to the  other suggest that the US is now widely perceived as arrogant and as war with  Iraq looms potentially reckless. You can hear the misgivings in the voices of Russian steel workers burned  by Washington\\'s decision this year to ignore free-trade principles and raise  import tariffs. You can see them in a McDonald\\'s franchise in Jakarta that  works to hide its American connection. And in South Korea, for the first time, anti-Americanism is no longer a  fringe emotion, fashionable on the political extremes. It has become a  mainstream current of respectable opinion. Fault-finding with America is becoming an instrument of national  solidarity, especially among younger people like Yonsei University student Ham  Chang, who thinks older generations that fought alongside US troops have been  \"brainwashed.\" \"My friends feel like the US acts as boss of the world,\" says Mr.  Ham, who is studying literature. \"Sept. 11 was terrible ... but the US is  using it as an excuse to do what it wants. The US government is in Korea to  divide us. The US wants us weak and divided. They are not here for our  security.\" In an unusually candid acknowledgement of the problem, President Kim Dae  Jung told reporters last Friday that he\\'s worried by \"a growing trend  toward anti-American sentiment.\" \"It may be difficult for us to sustain the same mood we grew up  with,\" says one older Korean diplomat who served in Washington. \"We  know the US helped us. But those under 40 ... aren\\'t swayed by what we think.  Their human nature is anti-US.\" /P>  Respect for American values freedom and democracy persists, as does  admiration of its free-enterprise prosperity. A visa for the US is still  prized. But because of the way the US is wielding its military and political  clout more than its cultural hegemony that admiration is increasingly overlaid  by mistrust, misunderstanding, resentment, and even hostility across a broad  spectrum of countries and citizens. There\\'s a feeling that Washington doesn\\'t  care about them or their concerns. \"Foreign perceptions of the United States are far from  monolithic,\" found a recent task force on public diplomacy set up by the  Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in New York. In Afghanistan and the  Philippines, for example, US soldiers are generally well received. \"But  there is little doubt that stereotypes of the United States as arrogant,  self-indulgent, hypocritical, inattentive, and unwilling or unable to engage in  cross-cultural dialogue are pervasive and deeply rooted.\" That is a far cry from the average American\\'s perception. Sixty-six percent  of Americans regard their country\\'s actions as \"usually or almost  always\" beneficial to the world according to a Monitor/TIPP poll taken in  the past week. \"I\\'m amazed ... that people would hate us,\" President Bush said  last October. \"Like most Americans I just can\\'t believe it. Because I know  how good we are.\" Some say that is enough. \"The rich hegemon will usually be unpopular,  deservedly or not,\" says Lewis Manilow, a veteran public diplomacy  specialist who dissented from the CFR report. \"Americans want to be loved,  but isn\\'t it more important that we tell the world where we stand and follow up  with appropriate action?\" Certainly, the US now holds greater economic, political, military, and  cultural sway over the rest of the world than any power since the Roman Empire.  It is the only military power with global reach, spending more on guns and  soldiers than the next 11 countries combined. It has 27 percent of the world\\'s  economic output, equal to the next three biggest countries combined. And it is  in a league of its own when it comes to film and TV exports. But brute strength does not always add up to leadership, and raw power  rarely fosters the sense of international common purpose needed to address  problems with the environment, disease, immigration, or global economic  stability. \"Military power is necessary but not sufficient,\" argues Joseph  Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in  Cambridge, Mass. \"The US should pay more attention to its ability to  attract others to work with it.\" /P>  That is what Sgt. Larry Moore\\'s job is all about. A soldier with the 489th  Civil Affairs Battalion based in Knoxville, Tenn., he steps out of his pickup  truck into the bright sunlight scorching the village of Karabagh, north of  Kabul, and surveys the war-scarred desolation around him.    \\'We\\'re doing this because these people need help. We are doing it for the same  reason you would do it for your neighbor.\\'  Sgt. Larry Moore, in  Afghanistan  Robert Harbison - STAFF     The few mud walls that are standing are pocked with bullet holes and the  star burst signatures of rocket-propelled grenades. Shattered adobe buildings  melt back into the dusty floor of the plain. But in the middle of the village  rises a red-brick schoolhouse where 1,200 boys and girls will soon be studying,  courtesy of the US Army. \"This school will be excellent,\" says Sergeant Moore with  satisfaction, as he watches a turbaned tribesman use an adze to smooth ceiling  beams while a dozen workmen in long shirts and billowing pantaloons slather on  mortar and lay bricks. \"It\\'s going to do wonders for the village.\" Karabagh\\'s new school is one of hundreds of humanitarian-aid projects that  the US military is funding in Afghanistan, and it has won over Dermont, a  village elder. A few months ago, he says, American soldiers on patrol \"saw  our children studying under the shadows of trees and they decided to build a  school. The school is a light in the darkness. I hope my children will be able  to see.\" Moore takes an idealistic view of his work. \"We\\'re doing this because  these people need help,\" he says. \"We are doing it for the same  reason you would do it for your neighbor. Do it because that\\'s what\\'s in your  heart. America has a kind heart.\" The US Agency for International Development says it has sent $530 million  in humanitarian aid in Afghanistan this year, making America the largest single  donor to the war-torn country. But that does not impress Karabagh policeman  Abdul Ghafur. \"We have two targets,\" he says, \"the  reconstruction of Afghanistan and eradicating the terrorists. The US is more  interested in the war against terrorists. We are more interested in  reconstruction.\" For Col. Nick Parker, a British officer who is director of operational  planning at coalition headquarters in Kabul, those two goals go hand in hand.  \"The US is not doing this for purely altruistic reasons,\" he  suggests. \"If the US doesn\\'t do it, in five years we\\'ll all be back here  fighting another terrorist organization.\" /P>  When American goals match local aspirations, America has no difficulty  presenting itself as the good guy. That is the logic behind the doctrine of  \"integration\" outlined recently by Richard Haass, the State  Department\\'s director of policy planning, who described it as \"persuading  more and more governments, and at a deeper level, people to sign on to certain  key ideas as to how the world should operate for our mutual benefit.\" But getting the rest of the world to want what America wants is only one  side of the coin, argues Professor Nye. America also has to offer other  countries things they value if foreigners are to accept American moral  leadership. \"Failure to pay proper respect to the opinion of others and to  incorporate a broad conception of justice into our national interest will  eventually come to hurt us,\" Nye argues in his recent book, \"The  Paradox of American Power.\" In the eyes of many global activists, Washington is ignoring that warning.  In Johannesburg, for example, Korean environmental activists protested against  Mr. Bush\\'s absence from the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development.  \"He only cares about his personal war against terror,\" said Kim Yeon  Ji of the Korean Federation for the Environment. \"They want us all to join  in with their war, but in the battle for the environment, we are all here and  he says, \\'Sorry, I\\'m on vacation.\\' We are very angry.\" America\\'s reluctance to join other countries in tackling issues they think  are important its current efforts to undermine the new International Criminal  Court, for example; its rejection of an international treaty limiting  biological weapons; or its refusal to strengthen a convention against torture  are squandering global goodwill, say critics. In France, warns Dominique Moisi, a prominent foreign-affairs analyst,  \"there is a growing tendency in public opinion to view the US as a rogue  state.\" /P>  Not that this makes Americans personally unpopular, as Jacqui Resley\\'s  employees will attest. Ms. Resley, a Kansan, strides around her crafts factory in Nairobi,  constantly taking charge. \"David,\" she admonishes one shy potter.  \"Stop painting those lines so squiggly. They look ugly.\"   \\'No matter what Godforsaken place you found yourself in, there was always  someone with a Coke, complaining about Vietnam but also asking if you could  help them to get a visa to the US.\\'  Jacqui Resley, American  businesswoman in Kenya  Sven Torfinn     Encouraging, correcting, yelling, insisting on it all being done the way  she thinks best, the tall and angular Resley pushes her 70 Kenyan workers to  their limits. \"There is this attitude here of \\'We can\\'t do it,\\' and I say  \\'For God\\'s sake why not?\\' she says, grimacing as she watches a weaver fumbling  a ball of thread. \"She is bossy,\" acknowledges Fidel Namisi, the company\\'s computer  technician. \"Bossy and hyper and good-hearted ... very American.\" Thirty years ago, inspired by a John Wayne movie filmed in the Serengeti  plains, Resley picked up and set off to hitchhike across Africa. The Vietnam  War was raging, and long before she reached Nairobi, she discovered that not  everybody loved America. \"A lot of people just didn\\'t like you because of the war,\" she  remembers. \"But no matter what Godforsaken place you found yourself in  there was always someone with a Coke, complaining about Vietnam but also asking  if you could help them to get a visa to the US.\" Today, she still runs into people like that, but Resley no longer carries a  backpack. Now she runs Weaverbird, the company she founded that supplies many  of the high-quality carpets, wall hangings, and pots that decorate Kenya\\'s best  hotels. She has also become one of Nairobi\\'s best-known community activists,  agitating against corruption and litter and in favor of government  accountability. As the only human face her workers can put on a distant  superpower, Jacqui Resley hears a lot from them good and bad about America. On  Sept. 11, Jane Mukonyo was on the factory floor, ball-winding wool, when she  heard about the attacks on the radio. \"Everyone looks around for  Jacqui\" she recalls. \"We wanted to tell her we felt so bad.\" \"I don\\'t know too many Americans, just Jacqui and those I see on  TV,\" says Joyce Njeri, a dyer who has worked at Weaverbird for 15 years.  \"But what I know I like.\" Americans, she explains \"know what they want, and others can\\'t teach  them too much. They want the bottom line. They take action. They are capable  and have big, good ideas. America as a country, Njeri believes, is much the  same. \"But I have a question,\" she adds. \"Why, if they have such  good ideas, are they now bombing others just like they themselves are  bombed?\" Mr. Namisi, the computer expert, is less enthusiastic. \"I definitely  think the US is a bully,\" he says. \"They look down at the rest of us.  They think their way is the only way.\" Lunch break is over, and Resley charges onto the factory floor, her hands  flying this way and that. \"One, two, let\\'s get moving here,\" she nags.  \"Jacqui is an American and, yes, she is bossy too,\" says Namisi.  \"But we signed up to work for her, so we accept that. But neither Kenya  nor any other country signed up to work for the US, so that is different.\"  /P>  Elsewhere in the world too, people are ambivalent about America:  \"Yankee Go Home, But Take Me With You,\" as an Indian politician,  Jairam Ramesh, titled a talk he gave three years ago at the Asia Society in New  York. Chinese students are not shy about protesting US policies, but a  demonstration outside the US Embassy in Beijing last month had an ironic twist  in its tail: the college grads were demanding American visas. \"The international role of the US is rude, it is a very negative  role,\" said Feng Ma, a young woman demonstrator who has won a full  scholarship to the University of Maryland after preparing for five years.  \"But I view individuals separately. My friends live a comfortable life in  Michigan. They work hard and they make in a year what it would take three years  here to make. \"We may hate the US when it is rude to China,\" she added.  \"But we long to go there.\" Nor is it hard to find people anywhere in the world ready to express their  admiration for the values and ideals that have inspired America\\'s growth  especially in countries where such values are not officially shared. \"Yes, America wants to do good things in the world and spread  democracy,\" says Yang Chu, a software salesman reading a raft of Saturday  papers over a cup of coffee at a downtown Beijing Starbucks. \"I wish China  had more American-style democracy.\"  \\'Anti-Americanism here  isn\\'t so much hatred as it is envy. It\\'s a parent-child relationship. The child  wants to be listened to and Dad is always busy.\\'  Jan Urban, Czech  service of US-funded Radio Free Europe     In Eastern Europe, too, plenty of middle aged people who knew life under  Communism are grateful to the US for its role in bringing down the Soviet  empire. (Warm feelings live on in the parlance of Czech hikers: When they find  an especially beautiful site to pitch their tents, they call it  \"Amerika.\") But that gratitude is ebbing away. \"I used to hold America in awe,\" says Vlastislav Vecerilek, a  former air-traffic controller who has had a hard time making ends meet since he  lost his job soon after Czechoslovakia\\'s \"Velvet Revolution.\"  \"But recently I have become annoyed with American policies. \"They promised us heaven and instead we got s      ',\n",

A new poll finds older people less supportive of a war than the young.   JOHN NORDELL - STAFF   Antiwar views split along generation gap Surveys find the young most  supportive of military action. Older citizens are skeptical.  By Ann Scott  Tyson | Special correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor  WASHINGTON  –Matthew Gardner, a 19-year-old Maryland college student, believes the  United States must use force to oust Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.   \"He\\'s really capable of anything,\" says Mr. Gardner, who worries  about Iraq\\'s potential use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.  \"The only thing you can do is go to war - it\\'s unavoidable.\"    E-mail a friend Print this Letter to the Editor Republish  E-mail newsletters RSS    Related stories:  10/17/02   Americans back Iraq war - warily      Get all the Monitor\\'s  headlines by e-mail. Subscribe for free.     Retired Air Force pilot Frank Houde, who recently joined tens of thousands  of antiwar protesters in Washington, D.C., holds a different view: \"Peace  is patriotic.\" Upsetting stereotypes of Vietnam-era protests by flower-draped co-eds and  flag-waving veterans, younger Americans are more likely to support the use of  military force against Iraq than are senior citizens, recent surveys suggest.  Americans aged 18 to 29 back US military action by a 3-to-1 margin (69  percent to 23 percent). In contrast, support falls to 51 percent among those  aged 65 or older, 31 percent of whom oppose a war against Iraq, according to  three surveys by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The apparent generation gap over Iraq is rooted in starkly different  experiences of war, as well a universal tendency for seniors to view the world  with a more cautious, jaded eye, whereas young adults feel bolder and more  \"bulletproof,\" experts say. JavaScript needs to be enabled to  view this interactive.   Older Americans\\' outlook on war has been shaped by long, bloody conflicts  such as World War II and the Vietnam War. By contrast, people in their late  teens and 20s have come of age in an era of relatively antiseptic conflicts  with few US casualties. \"Today\\'s generation, to the extent they have experienced war apart  from computer games, have lived through the Gulf War, which was very quick,  successful, and relatively bloodless,\" says William Galston, a public  affairs professor at the University of Maryland. He directs a center that  promotes research on the civic engagement of Americans aged from 15 to 25.  Among the young, optimism  Underscoring this point, senior citizens surveyed by Pew were far more  likely than younger Americans to believe that the United States would suffer  major casualties in a war with Iraq. Whereas 62 percent of those age 65 and  older anticipated a large number of US casualties, that view was held by less  than half of respondents from other age groups – including just 39  percent of 18- to 29-year-olds. \"I think there would be a lot of Iraqi casualties, but not so many  US,\" says Gardner, as he folds shirts at his part-time job at a clothing  store. \"If things go to the US plan, everything will be okay. We won\\'t  lose that many soldiers.\" Broad generational differences may also underpin views on Iraq, social  scientists say. Older people tend to be more risk-averse, whereas the young  generally see themselves as immune from harm. \"The younger the population and the more unattached young men around,  the greater the appetite for conflict,\" Mr. Galston says. At the same time, Sept. 11 proved especially troubling for younger  Americans, who may seek military retaliation. \"Sept. 11 alarmed and jolted younger people more than older  people,\" says Todd Gitlin, a sociologist at Columbia University.  \"It\\'s the first time the world knocked on their door ... and they are more  prone to be activated by fear to support a military response.\"  Heeding the political winds  A tendency for young people to reflect mainstream views could contribute to  the generation gap. \"The young go with the political winds,\" says Dan  Hallin, a communications professor at the University of California at San Diego.  On Iraq, young people are more accepting than seniors of the Bush  administration\\'s policy of preemptive strikes, and have greater confidence that  Washington will secure support from its allies, the Pew surveys show. While polls offer only a snapshot, similar age gaps have existed in past  wars. Despite a vocal antiwar movement, young people as a whole were more  reluctant to call US military action in Vietnam a mistake than were their  elders, Gallup polls from 1966 and 1970 show. Young people were also somewhat  more supportive than seniors of the use of US military force against Iraq in  1991. (A review of current polling on Iraq found no others that offered age  breakdowns that would allow a direct comparison with the Pew findings. A  Monitor/TIPP poll last month found that young people and seniors held similar  views when asked to gauge the importance of US military action to remove Saddam  Hussein from power in the next six months.) The irony of generational differences over war hit home recently for  retired Air Force Lt. Col. Frank Houde, a Vietnam veteran from Albany, N.Y.  Joining a mixed-age crowd of tens of thousands gathered in Washington Oct. 26,  he recalled his ambivalence over similar antiwar rallies of the \\'60s and \\'70s.  Back then, Mr. Houde remembers feeling chagrin that his 70-year-old mother  took part in the peace protests. As a career military officer, Houde says he would have preferred ignoring  the demonstrations. Now, as a 68-year-old father of five sons, including one who is an Air  Force engineer, Houde has come full circle. He is an active member of Veterans  for Peace. \"The older people, they remember their own innocence, and it really  hurts them thinking of young people going into this situation,\" says Woody  Powell, national administrator for Veterans For Peace in St. Louis.

Arising from the  national strategic plans for more balanced economic development, the State  Council of China decided to move the main body of Jiaotong University inland to  Xian in 1956. In 1959, the Xi\\'an part of Jiaotong University was officially  renamed Xian Jiaotong University, and was listed as the state key university in  China. Later, Xian Jiaotong University became one of the few selected  universities under the 7th Five-Year Plan and the 8th Five-Year Plan of China.  Xian Jiaotong University was the only university in the central and western  regions of China named by the State Council under the National Program of  Action for Educational Revitalization in the 21st Century to be a  world-renowned university. In April 2000, approved by the State Council, Xi\\'an  Medical University, Shaanxi Institute of Finance and Economics were merged with  Xi\\'an Jiaotong University and formed the new Xian Jiaotong University. XJTU is  one of the most prestigious universities in Mainland China, and was placed  tenth in the 2008 Chinese Universities Ranking.[1] It has been consistently  ranked as the top school in China for management studies since 2002.[2]   Chart of Jiaotong University History (Chinese version)   [edit] Present Today, Xi\\'an Jiaotong University has an enrollment of around 32,000  students and offers 199 Master\\'s and 114 Ph.D. programs in Science,  Engineering, Medicine, Economics, Management, Arts, Language and Law. In 2006, in partnership with the University of Liverpool, XTJU opened a  joint University inSuzhou, the Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU). This  is an independent University in its own right, and as such is the first  Sino-British University to be approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education.  XJTLU currently offers degree courses in Electronics, Communications, Computer  Science, and Management (including Financial Mathematics and E-commerce). When  fully operational, this independent University will have a student population  of up to ten thousand.

(February 2009)   As the rapid development and the fast growth of requirement of E-Learning,  Internet Education School of Xi\\'an Jiaotong University was founded in March  2001 as one of the first 15 experimental universities approved by Education  Ministry of P. R. China. As one of the important projects of \"Action  Plan\", more than RMB 5 million has been invested to E-Learning project  since 1999, now a hybrid international standard distance-learning system based  on satellite and CERRNET was built up and more than 100 multimedia coursewares  had been developed. With the strong support of excellent XJTU educational resources and  management experience, IES is striving for establishing a multi-level and  multi-form distance education. With the basic maxim of \"Basing on the  western, Orienting towards the whole country, Connecting overseas\", XJTU\\'s  E-Learning emphasizes at after-school education to meet the increasingly growth  of continue education. So far there are 51 distance learning sites scattered in all of China and  about 2,800 students, majoring in Computer, Nursing, Management, Law, and  Economics. The goal before 2005 is to build up 80 distance learning sites, and  recruit about 8000 students. With the satellite and the internet, XJTU has some cooperations with WAS of  Japan and Taiwan Jiaotong University. We have already made some live teaching  and resources transmission experiments. Since Sept. 2002, XJTU has begun to  cooperate with Shanghai Jiaotong University and Zhejiang University, these  three universities take the cooperative teaching method such as sharing some  optional courses and admitting the corresponding credits. Now there are more  than 6700 students taking such elective courses from 37 shared courses provided  by three universities. University also earnestly pay attention to the study of E-Learning theory,  technology and application. Since 1998, we have undertaken 12 very important  national projects, such as Action Plan project \"Multi-media Distance  Education System and Project\"; Education Ministry approved large project  \"the Demonstrate Project of Internet Education Based on Satellite and  Terrestrial Networks\", Tenth Five-year plan key project \"real-time  teaching system\", National Science Fund project \"Study of Individual  and Interactive Virtual Collaborative Learning Environment\" and  \"Study and Application of Personality Mining in E-Learning\". By  research, we have already applied 3 invention Patents of P. R. China. The  achievement of \"the distance learning system over satellite and  internet\" was awarded as second prize for scientific and technology  development of state education ministry. Another achievement was awarded as the  first prize by Shaanxi Province. XJTU also get an IBM SUR project, which  provides us two IBM H85 Servers. Now, we have 7 servers, more than 80 PCs, and  own an advanced network infrastructure. XJTU have now established a set of  supporting platform based on the combinative utilization of satellite and  terrestrial networks. In general, Internet Education School is progressing at  an unprecedented speed.[6]  [edit] Notable alumni Alumni include Qian Xuesen, Wu Wenjun, Zhang Guangdou, Jiang Zhenghua,  Jiang Zemin, and Han Qide.

ACC reconstitution efforts underway  (AFPN) 23 September 1999 -- Air  Combat Command is on track toward reconstituting its forces that experienced  higher-than-normal operations tempo during Operation Allied Force and other  recent deployments. ACC\\'s reconstitution plan gives 10 fighter and bomber  squadrons and 16 low-density, high-demand units needed time to work off the  backlog in training and deferred maintenance.   Army Readiness Background Briefing  November 10, 1999 - The issue is not  resource inadequacies -- that is, training, manning, or equipment shortfalls.  Instead, it reflects the fact that the Army\\'s current readiness reporting  system requires commanders to assess and report their unit\\'s level of readiness  based upon their ability to deploy ready forces to a major theater war within  time lines established in the war plans.   Cohen\\'s Top Feat May Be Monetary, Not Military  By Elizabeth Becker New  York Times November 14, 1999 -- \"We\\'re closer to the old cold war Pentagon  than we were three years ago,\" said John Pike, director of programs at the  Federation of American Scientists, a private group here.   10th Mountain, 1st Infantry are combat ready, officials say  (Army News  Service, Nov. 16, 1999) - Defense officials say although two Army divisions now  deployed to the Balkans reported lower personnel readiness levels last month,  that doesn\\'t mean they aren\\'t combat ready.   Cohen Addresses Readiness News  By Linda D. Kozaryn American Forces  Press Service 23 November 1999 -- Is the military ready to fight or not?

Prior Learning Assessment  Credit by Examination Credit by Challenging Cal Poly Courses  Credit for Military Training and Service   Prior Learning Assessment (PLA)  ADP is proud to announce the Prior Learning Assessment  (PLA). PLA is designed to help current and prospective Adult Degree Program  students learn how to develop and submit a portfolio for academic credit. Cal  Poly will award academic credit for college-level learning acquired through  life and work experiences, but outside a traditional college or university  classroom. The workshop provides information on how to search your past for  college-level learning, match your learning to college courses, and compile a  portfolio for evaluation. It also briefly covers the several other avenues for  earning academic credit for prior college-level learning which are available to  Adult Degree Program students.\\xa0 \\xa0 We have scheduled two separate workshops during spring quarter on 5/12/08  or 6/2/08, 6:00 - 8:00 pm. The fee is $35 and includes a handbook. Registration  is required. Contact the office at (805) 756-7196. \\xa0 Click here for more information and to enroll in a Prior Learning  Assessment seminar.   Students can also receive credit for professional development and training  by using the American Council on Education’s National Guide to College  Credit for Workforce Training. Through the American Council on  Education’s CREDIT program, hundreds of corporate, professional  development, and other educational programs have been assessed and equated to  college courses. If you have completed any of these courses, you may be  eligible to receive Cal Poly credit toward your degree. The American Council on  Education’s guide can be found online at www.acenet.edu/nationalguide/   Credit by Examination   Cal Poly grants credit to students who  successfully pass examinations approved for credit by the California State  University. These include the Advanced Placement Examination and some College  Level Entrance Program (CLEP) examinations. Credit will not be awarded if the  course already appears on the student’s transcript and the maximum amount  of credit is 45 quarter units (Advanced Placement Examination credit excluded).  For more information see the Cal Poly Catalog.  Credit by Challenging Cal Poly Courses  An ADP student may challenge a  course in which he or she is qualified through previous education by taking an  examination developed on campus. The examination may include written, oral, or  skills tests, or a combination of all three types. The examination will be  sufficiently comprehensive to determine that the student has the same knowledge  and skills as those students who successfully complete the course. For more  information see the Cal Poly Catalog.  Credit for Military Training and Service   Up to nine quarter units of  elective credit will be allowed for any student submitting evidence of  satisfactory completion of basic training. Credit is allowed in accordance with  the American Council on Education’s Guide to the Evaluation of  Educational Experience in the Armed Services.

In the first century after independence, the  US took military control of the North American continent, seizing territory  from the native peoples, and from Britain, France, Spain, Canada and Mexico.  Overseas military operations also began at an early date -- with the First  Barbary War of 1801-05, followed by the 1813 seizure of the South Pacific  island of Nukahiva as a military base. Washington proclaimed the onroe  Doctrine(1823) to deter European powers from intervening in the Americas, and  eventually to justify its own interventions in Peru, Argentina, Uruguay,  Colombia and many other countries. Territorial expansion later in the century  included the seizure of the Hawaiian Island chain (1893) and the conquest of  Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines in the Spanish-American War (1898).   The United States did not create a colonial empire of the type established by  France and Britain. Still, over the years, it has often used its overwhelming  military power. Though Washington regularly deploys oft powerthrough economic  and diplomatic pressure, it has rarely hesitated to employ military and  paramilitary means, as is clear in dozens of cases including Korea, Indochina,  Afghanistan and Iraq. The US now maintains hundreds of overseas bases, even in  large and wealthy countries like the UK, Germany, Italy, South Korea and Japan.  Washington has used many justifications over the years for its heavy emphasis  on military means. In the period 1946-89, much was explained by reference to  the old Warwhereas more recently the ar on terrorismhas pride of place. Today,  with unparalleled naval and air forces, the US possesses a unique capacity to  act militarily anywhere in the world, so as to forcefully pursue interests and  to affirm what US military planners explicitly call ull spectrum dominance.

The list does not  pretend to be definitive or absolutely complete. It does, however, demonstrate  that the US has engaged in military operations worldwide for political and  economic reasons for more than two centuries.

But my learning team experiences changed that. One of the greatest things about  the program was working with a global mix of people from all over the world. It  added a great perspective and dynamic to the class. I really like the split internship, too. Having three class experiences  spread out over the course of my entire program gave me the opportunity to  absorb and focus on specific skills and tasks throughout. I worked with a great  mentor principal and the support from University of Phoenix was great in making  the experience beneficial. I think the entire program was well balanced and  orchestrated. The content and instruction worked well with the class structure  and dynamics of both the individual and team aspect. Building the electronic  portfolio worked well to pull everything together.  Corey Christiaens Master of Arts in Education/  Administration and Supervision                 After earning a bachelors in biology, I decided I wanted to become a  teacher. The masters in education program at University of Phoenix provided  the flexibility I needed as a military spouse. The learning team experience  helped me become more patient and honest with myself about my weaknesses and  strengths and how I can better contribute to something. When I participated in  my first teacher work day, I was not afraid to speak out and contribute what I  learned in my program. The instructors put in a lot of time and effort to get  us ready for the real world of teaching. I felt prepared to embark on student  teaching and do well. After completing my student teaching, I felt confident  and able to start my new career.  Cynthia Giesecke Master of Arts In Education/  Secondary Teacher Education                 After earning my bachelors in bible/theology, I felt led to work with  kids, especially the ones many labeled as lost causes. I began looking into  other ways to earn certification and within a few weeks started my Master of  Arts in Education/ Cross-Categorical Special Education program at University of  Phoenix. While my classes were starting, I received an emergency teaching  certificate and began teaching students affected by learning disabilities or  emotional and behavioral disorders. The University of Phoenix program was  flexible so I was able to do my student teaching while working at the same high  school. I had a great learning environment and experience, while still working  to support my family. It was a phenomenal experience. I wouldnt trade it for  the world. Still, the most valuable part of the program was the interaction  with other teachers. I was one of many University of Phoenix students taking  classes while already teaching full time. I have learned so much from both the  faculty and other students in the program, which has helped me to become a  success both in and outside the classroom.

Admissions Glossary   Article Archives   Blog    Mythbusters: \"A Stack of Extracurricular Activities Makes Me a Super  Star Applicant.\"  Wednesday, 14 January 2009 11:38 by Melissa    If you\\'re a “Jack of All Trades” who signed up for every club  in school, you may win the prize for most memberships but you won\\'t be winning  the hearts of any admissions officers.    Fact: Colleges are looking for well-rounded, committed students.    Think about your track record for extracurricular activities:   Do you  rock at one or two activities?  Or  Do you flop around from club to  club spending the minimum time possible in each?   As you build your  college resume, think about how you are going to truthfully demonstrate that  you are well-rounded (engaged inside and outside the classroom) and committed  (dedicated to these outside pursuits). Colleges want to see that you have  well-developed interests and the ability to make and reach goals.   My  advice: Pick a manageable number of activities (less than three, for most of  us) and devote your time to being the best that you can be. Show steady  progress toward a defined goal, such as a leadership position or a higher  standing on a sports team.   Remember, your core academics are still  the primary focus when you apply. Extracurricular successes aside, you must  demonstrate that you have what it takes to graduate successfully.

But have you  ever thought about how a school\\'s price tag compares to how much its degree  will earn you in the future? SmartMoney recentlyreleased a list of the  universities that offer the biggest payoffs. By comparing tuition costs with  how much graduates were earning five and 15 years after graduation, they  created a payback ratio which shows the schools that are the best long-term  investments.   It turns out that several major public universities  offer the best bang for your buck. The Ivy League schools may come with more  prestige and better business networks, but their graduates do not necessarily  earn more than public school graduates in the long run.   To learn more  about SmartMoney\\'s findings and their ranking methodology, read thefull article . Here are some of the schools with the best payback ratio: \\xa0  Public Schools:    \\xa0\\xa0 1.

For the second year in  a row, eKnowledge, a company that sells SAT, ACT, and LSAT preparation  software, has teamed up with the NFL and the Department of Defense. Together  they will be contributing millions of dollars worth of eKnowledge\\'sSAT/ACT  PowerPrep Programs to members of the military and their families. They want  students in military families to have as much access to higher education as  possible during these trying times.   Anyone in the military, whether  retired or active, can request as many of the programs as they need for  students in their families. The Standard PowerPrep Program normally costs $199,  and military families get it for free (they only pay for shipping). The Premium  Program retails for $299.95, and military families can get this for $50. The  Combo Premium retails for $599.95 but is available to military families for  just $75.\\xa0 The software can be shipped to United States addresses and APO  addresses.   To ensure the discount only goes to those who are  eligible, the Department of Defense has made a secure website that confirms  military status.   At the time this blog post was written, 95,117  copies of the program had already been donated to military families.

Kagan (born March 1970) is an American resident scholar  at theAmerican Enterprise Institute (AEI), and a former professor of military  history at theU.S. Military Academy at West Point. He earned a B.A. in Soviet  and East European studies and aPh.D. in Russian and Soviet military history,  both from Yale University. He worked as an Assistant professor of military  history at West Point from 19952001 and as an Associate professor of military  history from 20012005. The courses he taught at West Point included the history  of military art, grand strategy, revolutionary warfare and diplomatic history.  He is brother to foreign policy analystRobert Kagan. Frederick Kagan is married  toKimberly Kagan, Assistant Professor of History at West Point and Executive  Director of theInstitute for the Study of War. Frederick Kagan and his father Donald Kagan, who is a professor at Yale and  a fellow at theHudson Institute, together authored While America Sleeps:  Self-Delusion, Military Weakness, and the Threat to Peace Today (2000). The  book argued in favor of a large increase in military spending and warned of  future threats, including from a potential revival ofIraq\\'s WMD program.[1]  Frederick along with his brotherRobert Kagan, who is a member of the Aspen  Strategy Group, and their father Donald are all signatories to the  neoconservative Project for the New American Century manifesto titled  Rebuilding America\\'s Defenses (2000).[2] Kagan authored the \"real Iraq Study Group\" report as the AEI\\'s  rival to theISG report of James Baker and Lee H.

       "   ' Sergeant Stubby - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Sergeant Stubby From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to: navigation, search     Sergeant Stubby wearing his uniform and medals  Sergeant Stubby (1916 or 1917 March 16, 1926), was the most decorated war dog of World War I and the only dog to be promoted to sergeant through  combat. Stubby was found on the Yale campus in 1917 by John Robert Conroy. He was  of unknown breed; some sources speculated that he was partBoston Terrier and  part Pit Bull, while other sources state that he was in fact a pure bred  american pit bull terrier[1] while his obituary described him as a \"Bull  terrier\" (which was at the time synonymous with \"American Bull  Terrier\" and \"Pit Bull terrier\").[2] Stubby marched with Conroy  and even learned an approximate salute. When Conroy\\'s unit shipped out toFrance , Stubby was smuggled aboard theUSS Minnesota. Contents  1 Military service 2 After the War 3 Medals and awards 4 See also 5 References 6 References     [edit] Military service Stubby served with the 102nd Infantry, 26th (Yankee) Division in the  trenches in France for 18 months and participated in four offensives and 17  battles. He entered combat onFebruary 5, 1918 at Chemin des Dames, north of  Soissons, and was under constant fire, day and night for over a month. In April  1918, during a raid to take Schieprey, Stubby was wounded in the foreleg by the  retreating Germans throwinghand grenades. He was sent to the rear for  convalescence, and as he had done on the front was able to improve morale. When  he recovered from his wounds, Stubby returned to the trenches. After being  gassed himself, Stubby learned to warn his unit ofpoison gas attacks, located  wounded soldiers inno man\\'s land, and since he could hear the whine of incoming  artillery shells before humans could became very adept at letting his unit know  when to duck for cover. He was even solely responsible for capturing a German  spy in theArgonne. Following the retaking Chteau-Thierry by the US, the  thankful women of the town made Stubby a chamois coat on which were pinned his  many medals. There is also a legend that while inParis with corporal Conroy,  Stubby saved a young girl from being hit by a car. At the end of the war,  Conroy smuggled Stubby home.  [edit] After the War   Stubby, as the Georgetown mascot  After returning home, Stubby became a celebrity and marched in, and  normally led, many parades across the country. He met PresidentsWoodrow Wilson,  Calvin Coolidge, and Warren G. Harding. Starting in 1921, he attended  Georgetown University Law Center with Conroy, and became the Hoyas\\' mascot. He  would be given thefootball at halftime and would nudge the ball around the  field to the amusement of the fans.  [edit] Medals and awards Stubby was made a life member of the American Legion, the Red Cross, and the YMCA. In 1921, the Humane Education Society awarded him a special gold medal  for service to his country. It was presented by GeneralJohn Pershing.  3 Service Stripes Yankee Division YD Patch French Medal Battle of Verdun 1st Annual American Legion Convention Medal New Haven WW1 Veterans Medal Republic of France Grande War Medal St Mihiel Campaign Medal Wound stripe, replaced with Purple Heart when introduced in 1932 Chateau Thierry Campaign Medal 6th Annual American Legion Convention Humane Education Society Gold Medal  In 1926, Stubby died in Conroy\\'s arms.

Of those, 2,491 were  enrolled in its main campus at Claremore in Fall 2007.[4] Contents  1 History 2 Academics 3 Athletics 4 Media 5 Greek life 6 References 7 External links     [edit] History   A statue of a soldier dating from RSU\\'s time as  Oklahoma Military Academy overlooks Claremore from the school\\'s entrance.  The institution that is now RSU has gone through several stages in its  existence, from its foundation as a state sponsored preparatory school, to its  transition to a military academy, and finally, to its current incarnation as a  four yearuniversity. It has its roots in the Eastern University Preparatory School, which  was founded in 1909. During the construction of the famous \"Preparatory  Hall\", Eastern University Preparatory School held its classes in the old  Claremont building until 1911. The institution was closed in 1917. In 1919 it was restarted as the Oklahoma Military Academy (OMA), to  meet the growing educational and training needs of theUnited States Armed Forces , and from 1923 to 1971 it offered secondary and collegiate education.  Thousands graduated from OMA, and over 100 alumni gave their lives serving  their country duringWorld War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. In 1971, the Oklahoma Legislature replaced the OMA with an institution to  grant two year associate degrees to the public known asClaremore Junior  College. In 1982, it became Rogers State College, named after the  county the main campus is located in,Rogers County, Oklahoma.[5] Rogers County  is in turn named in honor of Clement Vann Rogers, not Clem\\'s son,Will Rogers.[6] [7] In 1996, Rogers State College and the University Center at Tulsa (UCAT)  merged to formRogers University, with campuses in Claremore and Tulsa,  which operated for two years before being separated by the Oklahoma  Legislature. The part that had been Rogers State College became a member of the  OU Board of Regents, and was renamedRogers State University. RSU was  given permission to seek accreditation as a four year, bachelor degree granting  university. In 2000, RSU became the institution it is today, a public four  year, residential university. On August 16, 2006, Rogers State\\'s Stratton  Taylor Library was named aFederal depository library, the 20th in the state of  Oklahoma. In December of 2008, the university officially began its centennial  celebration with a lecture about local history and the unveiling of the  \"Centennial Clock\" outside of the new Student Services Center. The  centennial year of 2009 will be marked by a series of special events, lectures,  and celebrations. The most notable of these events is the opening of the new  Student Services Center, a recreational and administrative facility. The  building will serve a variety of purposes both to the university itself and to  the general public.  [edit] Academics   Stratton Taylor Library  RSU currently offers bachelor\\'s degrees in 15 areas: Applied Technology,  Biology, Business Administration, Business Information Technology,  Communications, Community Counseling, Game Development, Justice Administration,  Liberal Arts, Nursing, Organizational Leadership, Public Administration, Social  Science, Sports Management, and Visual Arts. In conjunction with Cameron  University, RSU also offers a \"2+2\" program in Elementary Education,  in which students can earn an associate\\'s degree in elementary education from  RSU and then transition to the final two years of a bachelor\\'s degree in  elementary education from Cameron, with all classes taught at RSU\\'s campus in  Claremore. RSU also offers associate\\'s degrees in 13 areas, which include Nursing,  Accounting, Elementary Education, and Computer science. RSU is a pioneer in online and distance learning through eCollege,  compressed video courses, and telecourses.

Florida National Guard  Certain members of the active duty Florida National Guard may be exempt  from the payment of one-half of the cost of tuition and fees for courses on a  space-available basis only. Students using this waiver may not register for  courses subject to the waiver until the last day of registration.  Certain members of the Florida National Guard may qualify for that portion  of fees not otherwise waived to be paid directly by the Florida Department of  Military Affairs when authorized by that agency. An approved authorization  billing must be presented to the Cashier’s Office on the main campus or  Fort Walton Beach Campus by the close of the drop/add fee payment period.  Authorization presented after that day will be subject to the assessment of the  late payment fee. Tuition Deferrals UWF also allows veterans to defer payment of tuition and fees. Deferral  eligibility is guaranteed to students receiving veteran’s educational  assistance benefits from federal or state assistance programs, where such aid  is delayed in transmission to the student through circumstances beyond the  control of the student.More info on veteran deferrals.  Veterans and other eligible students receiving benefits under Chapters 30,  32, 35, and 1606, U.S.C., will be entitled to one deferment each academic year.

Withdrawals  In the case of a student called to active duty military service  or change of orders due to military conflict within the semester, the student  must contact the Office of the Registrar and provide a copy of military orders  immediately. Students will have the option of withdrawing with a complete  refund, withdrawal with a grade of “W”, or accepting incomplete  grades to allow the student to complete the courses at a later date. Students  will be asked to notify the University of their desired option.  The  transcripts of students who have contacted the Office of the Registrar as  stated above and are subsequently withdrawn, awarded refunds, or given  incomplete grades will be annotated with appropriate statement indicating  action taken was due to military active duty service.

The foundation of the University's  evaluation and assessment initiative was set in the 1980s, consisting of the  Academic Quality Management System (AQMS), which focused on the performance of  educational support systems, and the Adult Learning Outcomes Assessment (ALOA),  which focused on the measurement of student learning in both the cognitive and  affective domains. Information gathered through these systems was used to  progress administrative and academic processes with the goal of improving  student learning. During the 2004-2005 fiscal year, the Office of Learning Assessment was  created to enhance areas of student, course and program evaluation. The  Learning Assessment team evaluated the AQMS and ALOA systems for possible  weaknesses and improvements. Discussions with college staff members and  information management specialists uncovered a need for a more focused and  extensive institutional evaluation and assessment system. From this evaluation,  the Institutional Quality Improvement System evolved. Institutional Quality Improvement System  The purpose  of the Institutional Quality Improvement System is to provide the means through  which data can be collected and used for continuous improvement of the  University. The assessment of student learning, combined with the measurement  and evaluation of other critical outcomes, provides the vehicles through which  the University maintains a cycle of continuous quality improvement. Academic Assessment Process  An in-depth evaluation of  the Institutional Quality Improvement System resulted in the addition of an  Academic Assessment Process to provide the framework for measuring student  learning and using this information to make continuous improvements to academic  programs. The Academic Assessment Process is comprised of four ongoing and  iterative steps:  Prepare annual assessment plan for academic programs. Prepare annual assessment result reports for academic programs. Implement improvements based on assessment results. Monitor effectiveness of implemented improvements.  The University's Academic Assessment Process includes an ongoing  combination of cognitive measures, including: course embedded assignments,  rubric scored assignments, portfolios and affective assessments   Colleges & Divisions  Arts & Sciences Axia College Business Doctoral Education   Global Health & Human Services Military (domestic) Technology  Programs  Degree Programs Accreditation  Tuition & Financial Options  Financial Options Scholarships Policies Student Loan Code of Conduct  Admissions  Student Experience Transfer Information Enrollment Process  Community  Students Alumni Faculty Online Community Campus Locations  About Us  Careers Media Relations Facility Rentals Apollo Group Support Contact Us  Site Map  RSS Feed Information Copyright & Legal           \\xa0  2006-2008 University of Phoenix, Inc.

The young men and women who make up our  armed forces represent virtues we\\'d like to see more of in society: integrity,  selfless service and loyalty to comrades and country, among others. Spend  enough time with them, particularly those serving in harm\\'s way, and you will  inevitably come home admiring them, and maybe envying them as well.  In his first book on the American military, \"Imperial Grunts,\"  Robert D. Kaplan focused on Army Special Forces teams and Marine units engaged  in unconventional wars around the world, from Fallujah to the Philippines. His  reporting conveyed an awe for the men and women he accompanied, with Kaplan  suggesting that they could function as both diplomats and fighters, the  vanguard of the American empire. Kaplan continues this love affair with his new  book, \"Hog Pilots, Blue Water Grunts: The American Military in the Air, at  Sea, and on the Ground\" - colorful dispatches from the lesser publicized  parts of the global war on terrorism. Kaplan sails across the Pacific on a Navy  destroyer, flies to Thailand with an Air Force bomber unit for a joint exercise  and sweats in the mountains of Central Asia with a team training a battalion of  Nepalese Army Rangers.  Kaplan consciously strives to emulate famed war correspondents like Ernie  Pyle and Richard Tregaskis, men who wrote with the pronouns \"we\" and  \"our\" to signify their emotional bond with the troops they covered.  Kaplan likes to give short portraits (like that for Capt. David Boone, \"an  intense, dark-haired and boyish-looking naval officer\"), in the style of  an old-fashioned combat correspondent. He also peppers his stories with brief  asides about military details, like the fact that the U.S.S. Benfold, on which  he sails, was named for the Navy medic Edward Benfold of Audubon, N.J., killed  during the Korean War and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. But Kaplan  doesn\\'t just admire the troops, he also praises their missions. Through their  exploits, he forms a vision of how the American empire might preserve itself:  as an international network of military power tied together by small foreign  bases, global air and sea capabilities, personal relationships with foreign  governments and American warriors willing to fight.  Take, for instance, the \"cooperative security location\" used by  the American military in Utapao, Thailand. Kaplan finds a United States base  there that is not a United States base, but rather a small airfield run by Dan  Generette, a private contractor and the chief operating officer of Delta Golf  Global. A retired Air Force master sergeant, Generette acts as logistical  manager, diplomat and local fixer for the American units that pass though,  facilitating every aspect of their stay. \"Look, this place ain\\'t Kansas.  When a crew of young American airmen arrive, they don\\'t know anything,\"  Generette tells Kaplan, adding that the Thais would \"rather deal with me  than with some loud and upset ugly American running around their base  complaining. I know the culture, the language. I\\'m kind and pleasant.\"  Arrangements like Generette\\'s in Utapao, and another on the small island  of Mactan in the Philippines, Kaplan writes, enable the American military to  operate abroad with a low profile, without formal alliances or status-of-forces  agreements and with little friction. In these, Kaplan sees how the American  empire might look in the 21st century - featuring a light American footprint,  and military forces that take pains to avoid offending local sensibilities  while still contributing to their security. This model carries some promise but  also considerable risk, for it neglects the traditional diplomacy and  international institutions that framed America\\'s superpower status during the  20th century.  \"Hog Pilots, Blue Water Grunts\" also offers an intimate glimpse  inside many kinds of American military units, each with its own culture. Kaplan  spends enough time with these men (most of the units he writes about are elite  ones that remain closed to women) to pick up the subtle implications of their  actions, like the way an Army Special Forces team intentionally lives in one  overcrowded tent instead of several smaller ones as a way of maintaining its  cohesion. The marines he accompanies in sub-Saharan Africa represent the most  conventional of the units he travels with: young, testosterone-filled men who  love their country and have no compunction about fighting for it. \"A  marine,\" one sergeant tells Kaplan, \"is only happy when he\\'s  fighting, humping with his backpack or on liberty - spending time with his  girlfriend or working under his car.\" At the other extreme, he writes of  the anal-retentive \"geeks with tattoos\" who serve in the Navy\\'s  submarine service, junior sailors and officers with advanced technical degrees  in nuclear engineering living for weeks at a time under the ocean\\'s surface.  What unites all these troops is a common faith, Kaplan writes - a belief  in their unit, their cause and the moral justness of their mission.  Paradoxically, that faith is mirrored in some of America\\'s enemies, like the  Maoist guerrillas in Nepal who are fortified by their own \"mystic  dimension of service and the sanctity of an oath,\" and quite willing to  die for their cause. In many places Kaplan finds this fighting faith deeply  rooted in the martial spirit of the military, an ethos of the American South  inextricably intertwined with Christianity - though he rightly points out that  America\\'s military faith is more secular and conservative than evangelical.  Still, he notes the absence of this faith among the country\\'s elites,  particularly its intellectual elites, and argues that this undermines our  ability to persevere in places like Iraq and Afghanistan: \"No matter how  much the combat arms community of the American military with its warrior ethos  believed in its worldwide mission, the American governing class, unlike that of  19th- and early-20th-century Europe, had less stomach for it.\"  Kaplan\\'s picture contains a great deal of truth. Fewer than 1 percent of  Americans serve in uniform today. The military\\'s officer and senior enlisted  ranks make up a self-selecting, self-reproducing warrior caste that  increasingly is socially, geographically and politically insulated from the  nation it serves. Occasionally, Kaplan\\'s reporting lapses into unabashed  cheerleading, obscuring the problems with the military\\'s missions or  strategies. Nonetheless, his book offers a valuable bridge across the country\\'s  widening civil-military divide. It is an important contribution to our  understanding of how this military works in the 21st century.  About the Author: Phillip Carter, an Iraq veteran and lawyer, is  writing a book about America\\'s relationship with its military.     More Information on Empire?

Musical theatre, an  important means of entertainment, social commentary, and civic engagement both  historically and in contemporary society, continues to have a part in Jesuit  education that combines personal formation with practical application for life  as an expression of Gods Glory in the world. Specific objectives of this  program include: entry-level proficiency for a career or further training in  graduate school; the development and practice of audition techniques;  performance of acting, singing and theatrical dance; and knowledge of the  cultural history and various forms of musical theatre. Two tracks are available  within the musical theatre minor. The first is focused upon American musical  theatre, and the second is focused upon lyric theatre (operetta/opera). REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in musical  theatre:  MUSC 1 and 1A or MUSC 7 MUSC 34, 60/160 THTR 20, 123 Two courses from DANC 40 (recommended for American musical theater), 43,  or 46 (recommended for lyric theatre)  Students in the American musical theatre option must also complete:  DANC 155 THTR 165, 180  Students in the lyric theatre option must also complete:  MUSC 103, 109, 150, 151        Home Campus Map Directory Site Index Contact Us Emergency Info © 2008 SCU Santa Clara, CA 95053    \",\n",

ABOUT DON ASK DON TELL  IN CONGRESS  LEGAL ISSUES  MILITARY STORIES  GET INVOLVED  NEWSROOM  ABOUT SLDN   In Congress The Military Readiness Enhancement Act (HR 1246)   In 2007, Rep. Martin Meehan (D-MA) and a bipartisan group of 109 original  cosponsors reintroduced theMilitary Readiness Enhancement Act  in the House of Representatives. Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-CA) is now the lead  sponsor, and is joined by 144 bipartisan cosponsors and counting. SLDN is  working with key allies to introduce parallel legislation in the U.S. Senate.   The Military Readiness Enhancement Act would repeal the  current ban on military service by openly lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans,  commonly referred to as“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”  It would replace the current law with new provisions prohibiting  discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Armed Forces. Current  regulations regarding the personal conduct of military members would remain  unchanged as long as they are written and enforced in a sexual orientation  neutral manner. Persons previously discharged for being gay would be eligible  to apply to rejoin the military.The Military Readiness Enhancement Act  would not create a right to benefits for same-sex partners or  spouses, because under current federal law such benefits would violate the  federal Defense of Marriage Act.  Repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”  would have a strong positive impact on military readiness in the U.S. Armed  Forces.  Repeal would help the military to recruit and retain critical personnel.  Over 12,500 service members have been discharged under “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” since 1993, and  countless others have made the choice not to join the military or have left  military service at the end of their commitments rather than live under this  discriminatory law. According to a 2005 GAO report, almost 800 persons  discharged under“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”  had skills deemed “critical” by the military. Discharging  linguists, doctors, nurses, mechanics, infantrymen, and intelligence analysts  for no other reason than because they are gay hurts readiness and negatively  impacts unit cohesion. Allowing gay Americans to serve will make our military  stronger.  Repeal will save millions of taxpayer dollars every year. According to the  GAO report, it has cost over $200 million to replace service members fired under “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” GAO admits  that this is an incomplete estimate; the true cost is even higher.  Repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”  reflects American values. Polling shows that 75% of Americans support allowing  gay Americans to serve openly in our nation’s Armed Forces. And Americans  care deeply about treating our service members and veterans with the respect  and thanks they deserve, not as second class citizens..

Contents  1 History 2 Campus 3 See also 4 External links     [edit] History The university was built before the Second Sino-Japanese War. One building  remains from that historical time. During the war, Japanese planes flew inland.  The elders in the town say thatYangling was the furthest west point that the  planes reached. This historical building suffered extensive damage from a  Japanese attack, but was rebuilt to a stable condition. This building, named  Building #3, is still used regularly for university classes. This building,  designed by an American architect, serves as a clock tower and houses the  university\\'sradio station.  [edit] Campus The University has two campuses: Xi Lin and Xi Nong. A butterfly museum on  campus is said to have the most extensive collection of butterflies in the  world. The university hosts a diverse array of students from provinces throughout  Western China. Restaurants between the two campuses are famous throughout Shaanxi province  for their belt-style noodles (noodles as thick as a belt). Some of the best  homemade yogurt in Shaanxi province is sold outside the teacher\\'s gate at Xi  Nong campus. The university hosts a large number of students, whose spending supports  the economy of Yangling.

The services report that most recruits fail to  complete basic training for medical reasons, including injuries and previously  undisclosed physical or mental conditions, and other performance-related issues.  DoD officials keenly watch recruit attrition numbers, especially since the  cost of recruiting new service members averages about $11,000 each -- some  $3,000 more than just a few years ago. Combined with an average cost of initial  entry training at $35,000, DoD\\'s investment in military recruit accessions and  training is enormous since more than 200,000 of America\\'s youth are recruited  for active military service each year.

       "   ' List of colloquial names for universities and colleges in the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   List of colloquial names for universities and colleges in the United States  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to: navigation, search     Because of the large number of universities and colleges in the  United States, and in some cases to because of their lengthy formal names, it  is common to abbreviate their names in everyday usage. Most simply, the type of  institution, such as University or College, in the name may be dropped, or some  component of the name abbreviated, such as Tech in place of Institute of  Technology or Technological University. Of course, the same nickname may apply to multiple institutions, especially  in different regions, e.g. USC is claimed by both theUniversity of Southern  California and the University of South Carolina. The abbreviation may be  non-obvious, e.g. KU is theUniversity of Kansas and not UK, which is commonly  theUniversity of Kentucky. In some cases, the nickname may be better known,  e.g. West Point rather than theUnited States Military Academy. This list of  colloquial names for universities and colleges in the United States  provides a lexicon of such names. This list includes only alternative names for institutions, and not  nicknames for their campuses, athletic teams, or personalities. Thus, it  specifically excludes mascots and athletic team names, for which seeList of  U.S. college team nicknames and List of U.S. college mascots.

This cooperative venture allows the student to:   Take advantage of the low tuition charges at both institutions. Achieve an associate\\'s degree and a bachelor\\'s degree from two quality  institutions. Obtain academic advising each semester from both institutions.

Credit Awards   A maximum of 60 credit hours is awarded for a Registered Nurse\\'s license.    Credit for formal military service schools is awarded based on the  recommendations of the American Council on Education\\'s Guide to the Evaluation  of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services (ACE Guide). The credit will  be awarded where it is applicable to a student\\'s degree program and in keeping  with the basic educational philosophy of Park.   Credit for military service: 4 credit hours are awarded to students  who have successfully completed basic military training. Enlisted personnel may  receive additional credit based on their military occupational specialty/skill  level. Commissioned personnel may be awarded up to a maximum of 20 credit hours.    Credit for Validated Learning Equivalency may be awarded for educational  experiences based on documentation submitted by the student and with the  recommendation of the appropriate Program Coordinator. A student may petition  for a maximum of 24 credit hours. No more than 24 hours will be awarded for  validated learning experience.Petitions for Validated Learning Equivalency  credit must be submitted within two terms of being enrolled, and a  student can petition for credit only one time. Review of Validated Learning  Equivalency Petitions will normally take six to eight weeks depending upon the  number of courses in the petition. Petitions submitted between April 1 and  September 1 may take considerably longer.\\xa0 Park University will also  accept validated learning from experience that is assessed and transcripted  under the auspices of selected regionally accredited colleges or universities  and also agrees to accept the credit assessment recommendations of specific  interinstitutional assessment teams that follow the basic guidelines of the  Council for Adult and Experiential Learning and when Park University  requirements are met. There is a $25 application fee for this service, and if  any credit is awarded, there is a $30 per semester credit hour awarded charge.  The per credit hour fees must be paid within 30 days of notification of credit  award.

A maximum of 27/30 credit hours from the General Examinations will be  accepted toward a bachelor\\'s degree.No credit is awarded for separate  subtest scores.    Credit is awarded for satisfactory completion of the CLEP/DANTES/USAFI/PEP  Subject Examinations based on the recommendations of the American Council on  Education (ACE). Credit can be applied to major core requirements.      A maximum of 30 credit hours from the Subject Examinations will be accepted  toward a bachelor\\'s degree.   A maximum of 57/60 credit hours from the General and Subject Examinations  combined will be accepted toward a bachelor\\'s degree.   A maximum of 27/30 credit hours from the General and Subject Examinations  combined will be accepted toward an associate\\'s degree.      Where duplication among college courses, credit for prior learning and  tests exists, credit will be allowed for only one. Credits awarded from CLEP  General Examinations and CLEP/USAFI/DANTES/PEP Subject Examinations will not be  substituted at a later date.   Back to Top 3. Record of Progress (Degree Audit) After the transfer credit has been evaluated, a degree audit is prepared  which itemizes the student\\'s degree completion requirements. The student must  complete the degree requirements in effect at the time of the initial  evaluation. The requirements are not affected if Park University changes the  degree program in future catalogs. In each degree program there are additional  electives required to complete the degree. However, the number of hours shown  on an individual student\\'s degree audit may vary from that in the catalog  depending on the individual record of each student. The degree audit is an advisement tool and does not constitute an agreement  or a contract. A final review is made prior to graduation to insure the  completion of all degree requirements. The audit will be corrected if an error  is found. The initial audit will serve as a record of admission to Park University  for purposes of financial aid and Veterans Administration eligibility. 4. Academic Records The Registrar\\'s Office maintains for each enrolled student an academic  record and a degree audit. All official academic transactions are recorded. At the conclusion of each term, the Registrar\\'s Office issues to each  student an official grade report. A degree audit reflecting all completed  courses will be available on request. A student may request oneFREE  official transcript at the end of each term of enrollment. Any student may  obtain extra copies of a transcript by filing an official request along with  the per copy fee.No transcripts will be issued unless at least one graded  Park course appears on the transcript. No outstanding balance may show on  the student\\'s account. Back to Top Attendance Instructors are required to keep attendance records and report absences.   Absences for cogent reasons may be excused by the instructor, but missed  work must be made up within the term of enrollment.   Work missed through unexcused absences must also be made up within the term  of enrollment; but unexcused absences may carry further penalties.   In the event of two consecutive weeks of unexcused absences in a term of  enrollment, the student will be administratively withdrawn, resulting in a  grade of \"F\".   An Incomplete will not be issued to a student who has unexcused or  excessive absences recorded for the course.   Students receiving Military Tuition Assistance or Veterans Administration  educational benefits must not exceed three unexcused absences in the term of  enrollment. Excessive absences will be reported to the appropriate agency and  may result in a monetary penalty to the student.   Reports of F grades (attendance or academic) resulting from excessive  unexcused absences for students receiving financial assistance from agencies  not mentioned in item 5 above will be reported to the appropriate agency.   Back to Top Registration   Registration periods will begin approximately one month prior to the  beginning of each term. Specific dates are publicized. Students cannot be given  credit for a course for which they have not registered.   The forms required to accomplish enrollment are:    a. Enrollment Data Sheet accurately completed and signed by the student. b. Completed and processed forms to award Veterans Administration  educational benefits, Pell Grant, Stafford Student Loan, Supplemental Loans for  Students (SLS), Military Tuition Assistance and tuition assistance from any  other agency. Proper approval signatures must be obtained by the student. c. Check, money order, MasterCard, Discover or Visa to pay for all fees and  costs.    Students who are not funded by Military Tuition Assistance must  pay for all tuition and fees at the time of registration. VA Vocational  Rehabilitation students are exempt from this policy.If, for any reason, the  assistance, benefits, or payment cannot be collected by the college, the  student assumes the obligation to pay in full all outstanding tuition/fees.    Missed Final Exams Only extraordinary circumstances warrant a student\\'s being allowed to make  up a missed final examination. It is the student\\'s responsibility to contact  the faculty member before the scheduled exam or by the end of the first working  day after the day of the missed exam to request permission to take a makeup  exam. In the process of determining whether a makeup exam should be allowed,  the burden of proof is on the student. The faculty member has the right to  request verification of any excuse offered by the student. A student who is denied permission to take a makeup exam may appeal  immediately to the Academic Director or Resident Center Administrator. The  appeal must be made in writing by the end of the first working day after the  day of the denial. The appeal will be forwarded immediately to the appropriate  Vice President whose decision will be final. Student Conduct Faculty members are expected to dismiss from their classrooms students  whose behavior is detrimental to good order in the classroom. Such behavior  includes, but is not limited to, the use of abusive or obscene language,  attending the class under influence of drugs or alcohol, etc. Students who are  dismissed from class may be given failing grades, suspension, or expulsion from  Park University. Students whose behavior, either verbal or written, is  detrimental to the good order of Park University may be subject to disciplinary  action ranging from suspension to expulsion from Park University. Students who  exhibit abusive or obscene language or behavior toward administrative personnel  or support staff are also subject to suspension or expulsion from Park  University. Back to Top Alternative Methods of Instruction  Individualized Instruction Individualized Instruction is a method by which a course offered in this  catalog may be completed in a tutorial mode. A student is allowed a maximum of  nine credit hours of Individualized Instruction during the Park University  career if the conditions listed below are met: To qualify for an Individualized Instruction course, a student must:   Be evaluated as a degree-seeking student at Park University;   Be in residence in a Park University program;   Be within nine (9) semester hours of completing a degree.   Approval for an Individualized Instruction course also requires the  following:   That a substitute course cannot be determined that would reduce degree  requirements;   That the course was not available in the immediately prior term, and   That the course is not scheduled to be available in the next term.   If qualified, the student must request an Individualized Instruction  Agreement through the Park University Administrator. The Agreement must include  the faculty member\\'s name, specific course requirements, meeting times (minimum  of 11/2 hours per week), and evaluation requirements and must be submitted to  the School for Extended Learning or Kansas City Accelerated Offices four weeks  prior to the beginning of the term. Final approval of the Individualized  Instruction is made by the Vice President for Distance Learning or MetroPark  Director, as appropriate, after a total review of the student\\'s record. Independent Study Independent Study is a method for completion of courses in this catalog  that do not require special equipment, instruments, machines and are deemed  suitable to be taught as an Independent Study. The course consists of a  prescribed program of study with provision for interaction between a student  and a Park University faculty member. To qualify for an Independent Study course, the student must:   Have been evaluated as a degree-seeking student at Park;   Have no access to classes in any Park University program;   Have completed no less than 9 of the 15 residency hours for an Associate\\'s  degree; OR   Have completed no less than 24 of the 30 residency hours for a Bachelor of  Science degree. OR   Have completed no less than 18 of the 24 residency hours for a Bachelor of  Arts degree.   If qualified, the student must request an Independent Study Agreement from  the Registrar. A student is allowed a maximum of six credit hours through Independent  Study to complete the residency requirements. Each three hour course carries a  maximum completion time of six months. Final approval of all Independent Study  courses is made by the Registrar. All charges, regardless of funding, must be paid in full by check or money  order when the Independent Study is approved. Courses Offered Online Through Internet Courses are offered Online from the current Park University catalog and  taught in an accelerated format 5 terms per year. Students may register for  courses during their Park University career any term the courses are offered.  Contact with the instructor must be made on a weekly basis. Syllabi on the  Internet indicate required homework and tests. A conference room is set up  where students and instructor communicate or a student may contact the  instructor privately. The student must have his or her own access to the Internet. \\xa0 The  online courses will apply as residency toward a degree.   ^ Back to the Top  --------------------------------- University Resources  - Quick Links - Academic Support Admissions Alumni/Friends Assessment  Athletics Bookstore Campuses Career Development Class Schedules Commercial  Underground Contact Us/Maps Degree Programs E-mail Login Employment/Job Openings Financial Services General Counsel Graduate Students International Programs ITS  Help Desk Library Military Students Music Programs News & Events OPEN Login  People@Park School for Online Learning Strategic Planning Student Services Guide Syllabus Transcript Request    \\xa0     \\xa0   Park University • Office of Admissions  8700 NW River Park Drive  • Parkville, MO 64152  Tel.

The original version of the film, made by PBS houseboy Ken Burns, included not  a single word or image about the participation of over 500,000 Latinos in the  U.S. military during the war. After an outcry from numerous Latino  organizations and individuals, PBS agreed to include interviews with two Latino  veterans for a total of about twenty minutes. Reviewers have described the  added material as being cursory and disconnected from the rest of the film.  Obviously, twenty minutes is not enough but Burns arrogantly refuses to  acknowledge his original mistake, the result of bad research and a blindness to  the full panorama of the American experience.  For more background,  here are three articles I wrote early in the controversy:  February 14,  2007   March 28, 2007   May 9, 2007   Watch a Spanish  language op-ed on the Burns fiasco byEduardo Quezada Escandon   #  posted by Jorge Mariscal @ 8:56 AM  Monday, August 27, 2007 \\xa0   The General Reports  Counterpunch: The General Reports   In the August 26 edition of the Washington Post, Shailagh Murray reported  on Petraeus\\'s current position as recounted by Representative Jan Schakowsky  (D-Illinois) after her recent trip to Iraq. It appears that Petraeus may behave  more like Westmoreland than I had anticipated:  \"But the military  presentations left her stunned. Schakowsky said she jotted down Petraeus\\'s  words in a small white notebook she had brought along to record her  impressions. Her neat, looping handwriting filled page after page, and she  flipped through to find the Petraeus section. \" \\'We will be in Iraq in  some way for nine to 10 years,\\' \" Schakowsky read carefully. She had added  her own translation: \"Keep the train running for a few months, and then  stretch it out. Just enough progress to justify more time.\" \"I felt  that was a stretch and really part of a PR strategy -- just like the PR  strategy that initially led up to the war in the first place,\" Schakowsky  said. Petraeus, she said, \"acknowledged that if the policymakers decide  that we need to withdraw, that, you know, that\\'s what he would have to do. But  he felt that in order to win, we\\'d have to be there nine or 10 years.\" \"But it wasn\\'t just Republicans who came away impressed after visiting  Iraq. Rep. Brian Baird (D-Wash.) announced that he will no longer support a  timetable for withdrawal, warning of a \"potentially catastrophic  effect\" on the region. Schakowsky acknowledged that the military\\'s  presentation may have been effective. \"If you took the briefings at their  face value, without context, without bringing anything to it -- clearly they  were trying to present that positive spin, and that\\'s what [other lawmakers]  took away from it.\" Schakowsky said she asked U.S. officials about the  consequences of withdrawal, and she conceded that \"they painted a very  dire picture.\" She looked again through her notebook for a Petraeus quote.  \"He said: \\'If you don\\'t like the humanitarian crisis, the refugees and the  internally displaced people, you can\\'t draw down. If you are concerned about  these people, the humanitarian crisis, you should be for our staying here.\\'  \"  # posted by Jorge Mariscal @ 10:26 AM  Thursday, July 26, 2007 \\xa0   Pentagon\\'s Push for DREAM Act Heats Up COMD: Committee Opposed to  Militarism and the Draft   In recent months, several Chicano  organizations have spoken out against the military component of the DREAM Act:   Association of Raza Educators  Says NO the the Dream Act   In the past month, numerous non-profit organizations have been using university  student activists to hold rallies and demonstrations in support of the  National DREAM Act. The DREAM Act would allow SOME undocumented students to  attain permanent resident status if they meet one of the following criteria:  A degree from a two- or four-year institution of higher education, OR    Good standing for at least two years at an institution of higher education  while working toward a bachelor\\'s degree or higher, OR  SERVICE IN THE U.S.  IMPERIALIST ARMED FORCES for at least TWO YEARS.  Since most of these  student activists meet these requirements, they hope to gain their own legal  status by getting this bill passed. Many of the proponents of this bill also  emphasize the educational components of this bill, but are purposely ignoring  the last and most important criteria: Military Service.  According to  research on the education pipeline for Raza students, the vast majority will be  forced to legalize by joining the US Armed Forces. We hope that these  activist and non-profit organizations look past their self-interest and think  carefully about the adverse effects the DREAM Act will have on the ENTIRE  undocumented community and on poor peoples around the world.  Since  Proposition 187 was introduced in the 1990s, the Association of Raza Educators  (A.R.E.) has organized and fought for the democratic and human rights of our  Gente both inside and outside of the classroom. Here in Los Angeles, A.R.E. has  been at the forefront of organizing students and community members to march and  fight against racist legislation like H.R. 4437. In the past year, A.R.E. has  also brought awareness to the injustice faced by undocumented students and have  been proactive in our efforts to assist these students. This year alone we  raised over $10,000.00 and awarded it in scholarships specifically for  undocumented students.  A.R.E. supports the unconditional and full  legalization for ALL our Gente; however, we do NOT support the DREAM ACT  because it will do irreparable harm to our community by causing a de facto  military draft for our undocumented youth.  ARE will not sell-out ALL  Raza youth so that a FEW of us can get legalized and go to college!   The State badly miseducates our youth and the majority of our youth either gets  pushed out of school or are ill prepared to go to college. According to  National Stats for every Raza student who will attend a two or four year  college, TWENTY will not. Under the Dream Act, this will leave the militarily  as the only viable option for the majority of undocumented Raza youth.   We do not accept the stipulation of military service as a requirement for  citizenship. Poor people of color (mostly Africans and Mexicans/Indigenous  People) have built this county and have suffered years of discrimination and  injustice, but for supporters of this bill, that is not enough they still wish  to push us into their military to fight their wars. By failing to address the  route of legalization through militarization, these activist groups are  consciously and willfully supporting a bill that would force the majority of  Raza youth to fight in Iraq and in future imperialist wars. As progressive Raza  Educators, we firmly stand against the DREAM ACT for this reason.   A.R.E. has constantly stood against the militarization of our schools and youth  for the purposes of fighting unjust imperialist wars of aggression against  other poor people of color. There have been over 3,500 U.S. soldiers dead since  the beginning of the war in Iraq, and tens of thousands injured.   With  the passage of this bill, the U.S. will fill its ranks with immigrant and  migrant soldiers, thereby relieving its own sons and daughters of danger while  they put ours in harms way.  Moreover, the U.S. has already placed  6,000 U.S. Troops at the US/Mexican border. Will our Raza youth become US  mercenary soldiers who will be forced to point the gun at their own family  members when they patrol the border? Will we support the DREAM ACT that will  force our youth to join the same imperialist military that invaded Mexico, El  Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama and countless other Latin American Countries? A.R.E. asks all our Gente to please look closely at the DREAM ACT and  reconsider your support for a bill that will cause a de facto military draft  for our youth.   Yes to Full Legalization for all our Gente!   Yes  to Education for all of our Youth!  No to the National Dream Act!   No  to the Militarization of our Youth!

The ways are to earn a degree  from an institution of higher education [community college] or to complete two  years in a bachelor\\'s or higher program, or to serve honorably in the military  for at least two years.  Since that time, conservative intellectuals  calling for the use of immigrants and non-citizens to fill military manpower  needs have made the connection between the DREAM Act and military service  explicit. See, for example, Max Boot\\'s proposal from 2005: http://www.cfr.org/publication/8186/defend_america_become_american.html  In his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 10,  2006, Under Secretary of Defense David Chu made the connection even plainer:  \"According to an April 2006 study from the National Immigration Law  Center, there are an estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented alien young adults  who entered the U.S. at an early age and graduate from high school each year,  many of whom are bright, energetic and potentially interested in military  service...Provisions of S. 2611, such as the DREAM Act, would provide these  young people the opportunity of serving the United States in uniform.\" Although the educational component of the DREAM Act deserves our support,  we should be concerned about the covert military component. As I wrote in my  2004 article: How will we react if in five or ten years the vast majority of  undocumented youth, trapped by limited life chances and seduced by the promise  of legal residency, has been tracked into military service instead of higher  education? If dominant institutions in the United States believe emotional  Latinos are out of step with Americas system of education (see article  above), what is to prevent the tracking of Latino youth away from college and  into the armed forces?  # posted by Jorge Mariscal @ 7:14 PM  Friday, June 30, 2006 \\xa0   Mexican-Americans, Iraq and the Politics of Immigrant Bashing  Mexican-Americans, Iraq and the Politics of Immigrant Bashing   #  posted by Jorge Mariscal @ 10:48 AM  Friday, March 31, 2006 \\xa0   The \\'sleeping giant\\' awakens (again)  The \\'sleeping giant\\'  awakens (again) | The San Diego Union-Tribune   # posted by Jorge  Mariscal @ 9:56 PM  Thursday, March 30, 2006 \\xa0   Interview on Military Recruitment of Latino/as (in Spanish)  Insumissia - Jorge Mariscal habla sobre el reclutamiento de latinoamericanos en  el ejrcito de Estados Unidos   # posted by Jorge Mariscal @ 6:14 PM  Tuesday, January 24, 2006 \\xa0   Bush\\'s War Viewed from the South Jorge Mariscal: Bush\\'s War Viewed  from the South   Version en espanol:  http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=25991\">   On the issue  of women in the military, I received the following message from a woman vet in  rural Texas:  \"I was in the USMC 4 yrs after high school \\'79 - \\'83  during peacetime.

More than 500 students participated at one point or another.   The anti military movement here in Mayaguez is very ample. It includes both  professors and students at the university and town people During the years of  the first stage of the Vieques struggle we picketed a small shopping center  near the univeristy where all the military recruters have their offices every  Friday at noon. For the past year we have picketed the same offices once a  month.  Murals were painted both in the University by students and in  front of the university by town people condemning military recruitment. Posters  have been put up not only in Mayaguez but throughout Puerto Rico which say  \"US Army : A Useless Way to Die.\"  Last school year here in  Mayaguez, the Army ROTC had a total of 125 students.. This school year it has  gone down to 75. Air Force ROTC had about 75 participants last year this year  it has 40.  The conference at the university is serving as the kickoff  point a stepped up anti military campaign. We are conscious that Puerto Rican  universities serve as one of the greatest sources for Hispanic military  officers because of the ROTC programs. Slowly but surely we are using peaceful  means to convince students that this is not a good choice.   Mayaguezanos con Vieques  Maria M.

Alberto Gonzales   Version en espanol:  http://www.laopinion.com/print.html?rkey=00050117140603219133   The  category \"Hispanic\" has become common currency to such a degree that  my attempt in this article to redefine it in negative terms was lost on some  readers who read my piece as actually supporting the confirmation of Alberto  Gonzales. The issue was complicated further in the Spanish translation in which  \"Hispanic\" became \"hispano,\" a generic term used by many  recent immigrants and one that does not connote the (a)political attitudes I  ascribed to \"Hispanic.\"  In my opinion, Gonzales should not  have been confirmed. His ascension to the position of Attorney General further  demonstrates how the Bush administration has perfected the practice of using  token minorities to further a reactionary agenda. Any race or ethnicity-based  political agenda will have to confront this development for decades to come. For Mexican Americans, even those who find reasons to be proud of Gonzales  and Lt. General Sanchez, there is the inescapable irony that both men acted as  links in the chain of command that led to the torture and abuse of prisoners in  Iraq and Guantanamo. Both were \"simply\" following orders but both  were guilty of grave ethical lapses and the betrayal of their professional  (legal and military) codes of conduct.     # posted by  Jorge Mariscal @ 3:03 PM  Friday, December 31, 2004 \\xa0   Entrevista con Contralinea (Mexico); Interview in Spanish Revista  Contralnea | LNEA GLOBAL | Jorge Mariscal, veterano de Vietnam   #  posted by Jorge Mariscal @ 3:18 PM  \\xa0   In the Year 2053  LatinoLA - Forum - Your opinions and  commentaries   Version en espanol:  http://www.pacificar.com/vernota.hlvs?id=1007   On the long-term  effects of the Iraq war on the young men and women who serve, watch the  following video movie:  http://www.purpleheartsbook.com/vid.php   # posted by Jorge Mariscal @ 2:47 PM  Monday, December 27, 2004 \\xa0   A Mexican American General in the Service of Empire The Black  Commentator - A Mexican American General in the Service of Empire - Issue 98    Version en espanol: http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=1215  After publishing this article on Lt. General Ricardo Sanchez, I received an  e-mail message from one of his daughters. She felt that my article unfairly  criticized a man I did not know, and she suggested that in the future her  father would be exonerated from any responsibility for the torture scandals in  Iraq. I have attached my reply below.  Since this exchange in July of  2004, additional revelations about the widespread use of torture by U.S forces  confirm my belief that Lt. General Sanchez was following orders issued by the  highest levels of the Pentagon (Rumsfeld) and further complicated by Alberto  Gonzales\\' dismissal of the Geneva Conventions and related executive orders  signed by Mr. Bush. See the document proving Sanchez\\'s involvement at:   http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1222301,00.html    Estimada Ms. Sanchez: Thank you for your thoughtful note regarding my article.  You have defended your father well as I hope my daughter would do in the same  circumstance. My article was not intended as a personal attack on Lt. Gen.  Sanchez. On one level, I admire him for having been able to rise to such  prominence. I am quite sure he has overcome a great many obstacles both in the  military and in civilian life. My concern as a veteran and an educator is that  the military\\'s inculcation of \"following orders\" no matter what robs  too many of our gente of their humanity. We can try to disguise what we are  doing by claiming to be exporting \"democracy\" or \"defending our  freedom.\" But too often the politicians put our soldiers in situations  where they should not be, indeed where they may be forced to commit terrible  acts that will haunt them for the rest of their lives. I have seen this happen  in Vietnam and I see it now with the Mexican families that have lost their sons  and daughters (physically and psychologically) to an unecessary war in Iraq.  The idea that we Latinos/Mexicanos are \"warriors\" by nature drives  too many of our young men into gangs or into the military. This can only rob  our community of the young people whose talents we will desparately need in the  future. Enjoy your father now that he has left the war zone. I wish you and  your family all the best. Desde California recibe un saludo cordial, Jorge  Mariscal   UPDATE: Lt. General Sanchez quietly retired on November 1,  2006.

The  Report is a transparent look at how University of Phoenix measures itself and  at how it measures up in the current higher education environment. The Report has been generated in large part from an internally-developed  dashboard of key indicators that the University monitors as part of a system of  continuous improvement. The purpose of the Report is to provide a profile of  the University and to assess the success of the University in fulfilling its  social agenda and Mission to provide access to higher education opportunities.  Working from the baseline data in this document, it is our intention that  future Academic Annual Reports will continue to chart our progress and serve as  a model for others to consider.

Republicans will be more likely to support the existing policies, but  keep in mind that many Democrats also support the war in  Iraq  and are in  favor of an extended American troop presence.
